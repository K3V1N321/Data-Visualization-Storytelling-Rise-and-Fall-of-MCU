While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot.

... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision.

Overall a brilliant show that shouldn't be judged on the first three episodes (especially if your only complaint is a lack of plot)",1.6K,427

Something is obviously wrong--from the random splashes of colour, the ironman-coloured toy helicopter, the way Vision's boss seemed to magically suddenly decide to leave and promote Vision, the Hydra symbol on a watch, the fact that neither Vision nor Wanda seem to have the faintest notion how they got there, and, of course, the voice asking ""who did this to you, Wanda?""

WandaVision,tt9140560,georgefligos,"Jan 14, 2021",8,This one probably should have been releashed as a season.,"I was really excited by this title and I still am, ALTHOUGH I just watched two episodes of the show and I'm a bit at a loss. I'm not scratching my head as to what happened, I like being puzzled, but I am not yet sure if the first two episodes really add up to anything and I am afraid of how that is going to translate to the series as a whole. Don't get me wrong, I adore the concept, but I feel that I watched a standalone story with only a fraction of what might be the actual story. I got really excited at first only to feel a bit bored later. It needed more excitement, thrills and/or mystery. Or such a slow and (pardon me for saying this) monotonous beginning should have been releashed as a whole, in order to offer the whole colourful and multilayered experience we have all been waiting for (and I bet we will get by the end). For the reasons I explained, I believe it didn't leave a nice taste to a good amount of people. This is definitely not the next ""Mandalorian"" for Disney+, but I am glad they are taking risks and pushing the boundaries that we came to expect for a superhero medium. I hope the show finds its footing soon so it won't just feel like a special. High hopes, still. *EDIT* Just watched the third episode. And I, still, stand by my words. We're getting there, but slowly. I insist that it would be a more pleasant experience as a binge, because I still feel I watched nothing essential. *EDIT* EPISODE 4 WAS GREAT!",261,233

WandaVision,tt9140560,nsantalu,"Jan 14, 2021",8,"Starts off really rough, gets very good in ep 4","Watching eps 1-3 I had thought the show would start like this each episode as a delusion in Wanda's mind and then back to the real world live and in color. But no, Disney/Marvel went all in on the 50s-70s TV style and the results are lots of mixed and and negative reviews.

One could say that the first 3 episodes each pay homage to a different era in classic TV or perhaps they each just make fun of them. In either case come episode 4 it all starts to get really good and you start to understand why they did what they did and how they did it.

After Episode my rating of the show was a 2/10. That said i still hung in there hoping i was missing something and that if I could hang in there it could get good or maybe just maybe even great. Well I'm very pleased to say I was wrong about my initial review and score and after episode 4 have adjusted both accordingly.

I do believe Disney+ would have been much better off releasing the first four episodes all at once to avoid losing viewers that where as confused and frustrated as I was.

My new score of 8/10 would probably be a 10 if the episodes where longer and if there were going to be more than just 9 in total. With each episode only having about 18m of content and 12min of credits and ""previously on"" that means WandaVision in whole will only be about 2.7 hours long. That means it is basically a feature length movie split over 9 episodes for the sake of having it be a ""mini-series"" or ""TV show""

At any rate unless the show takes another turn after episode four I think we are in for a good ride overall. Try your best not to tune out during ep 1-3 and YES you do need to watch them ep 4 will be meaningless to you without having seen them.",205,255
WandaVision,tt9140560,pissbaby_,"Jan 14, 2021",8,"A Delightful Superhero Soap, unlike anything in MCU","Part loving whimsical homage to Classic TV history, part off tantalizing kilter mystery, WandaVision is a wonderfully weird and strikingly bold step into the small screen for the MCU - and a perfect showcase for Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany. Marvel goes off on a bizarre and audacious twists and a world away from the usual explosions and super-punching yet confidently delivered tangent, bringing back familiar characters in a fresh and imaginative way. Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany deliver the comedic goodies, as the series drops delightful comic book Easter eggs and it's mystery unfolds towards the phase 4 in MCU. Watching the first two episodes proved that the show is definitely expertly produced and spectacularly written with some beautifully performed twists on TV history, and Olsen and Bettany commit hard to the cheesy comedy.

WandaVision,tt9140560,hugomatraquilho,"Jan 14, 2021",10,Review bombs are the unfortunate result of the popularity of this franchise,"With the mainstream appeal of a franchise like Marvel, you unfortunately get a mass of spectators who became marvel arm chair experts without knowing any of the source material or the overarching plots that are being laid before us. Which is why you are seeing posts absurdly review bombing this show with an undeserved sense of authority and indignation. Wandavision is a treat for any long time fan of Marvel (especially of Scarlet Witch and Vision). Those of us who have waited to see many of the aspects alluded to in the show are completely ecstatic in noticing every little hint cleverly woven into the plot. Those who've read comics like Tom King's take on Vision or House of M will certainly feel familiar elements. It's a greatly produced homage to sitcom history, with meticulously crafted sets that are authentically appropriate. And at the same time, it's also has a sort of psychological horror and mystery to it, which contrasts nicely in an idyllic yet unsettling setting. The best part about this show, is that a lot of it is happening between the lines. It's highly replayable and the weekly format is great because it keeps all the speculation and guesswork going. Every frame is filled to the brim with hints and clues as to what the ""mystery"" really is, what entities are really at play and what their motivations are. It's a really bold, creative swing for a generally safe and formulaic Marvel. And in my opinion, it's a completely successful one so far.",179,184
WandaVision,tt9140560,ThomDerd,"Feb 5, 2021",8,Wandavision is kewl.,"Show is developing nicely and although the build up is slow, by episode 5 the story progresses more and gets interesting. World building seems good, characters are solid and there's an eerie vibe in every episode which makes it intriguing.

Also, this show is somewhat different; many double meanings and implications. Feel free to interpret. Wandavision is already a pun.

On another note, I am happy to see many actors from various MCU films appearing. Also, the core cast of this show is pretty good (see Kathryn Hahn) and OlsenBettany are given a nice chance to show some more acting skills and deliver comedy on top of the drama and action that we are used to.

But this series is just not as good. Its not because of politics or of political correctness or of racial mentions; its because of the PLOT.

Which kinda sucks. Inconsistent and at many times just pointless, the plot seems uninspired and forced, in order to make this series' story move forward.

Here's a few: What exactly was Carly's main motivation? What makes the GRC so bad for Carly? Why don't they work more on the idea of the shield as a mantle? That could have been a great opportunity here.

Why get into the power broker story arc in the first place and not further develop it?

And why spend so much time in the political issues? Is that because the script is just non-existant? Maybe... The dialogue at times is also incredibly stupid...which makes me wonder about the way marvel/disney approach their audience nowadays.

Wandavision was not perfect but it was smart and well made with good dialogue and world building. But this one is more closer to a messy, character-lacking and backstory-missing series.

Now why 6,5? 1-The action sequences are good and the start is impressive. Also there is a few more action sequences further on which are worth it. 2-Stan and Mackie are good action actors and look alright on screen, so its fun watching them and their chemistry is ok. 3-because i m a fan like most people here and i still like watching these stories and I appreciate the effort needed to get these done.

MCU has built complex characters with emotional intelligence throughout all their movies, and this feels like an outlier. Having little soul, the story is mostly boring. The only interesting parts are the non-superhero scenes that talk to racial tensions. Those scenes have depth and realistic context which, in other MCU movies exists throughout the entire story and action scenes.

Pros:

I like the actors, they do good with their script and their onscreen chemistry is great I like a lot of the loose plotholes this show is tying up. There were a lot of them left dangling and so they should be wrapped up. (Zemo, Other Winter Soldiers) I like they are shedding light on forgotten Avengers like Winter Soldier and Falcon. It was good when they did that in Wandavision and it is important to remember supporting characters

Now, for my least favorite/favorite part of a review: the cons

(I will try to be quick as I am fond of this show and while it has flaws my low rating will get higher)

It is taking a long time to build up. For Wanda Vision it worked well, but for such a quick paced show it needs to get somewhere faster We kind of skipped over Sam's family issues and Bucky's trauma in favor of more action. While I like action, those were important story elements.

There are too many names to keep up with and it isn't explained well what is going on. That I think they could have done better.

Final thoughts:

It is too early to review this show. I am leaving my review so far and intend to update it, so most of the issues will probably get addressed. If you are questioning the authenticity of my review, be aware it is of the quality of the show itself and how I feel, for clarification, so this is my opinion and please feel free to disagree.",231,158

Even though we only have 1 episode I can already say this is far stronger then what I was expecting, the action was really well done, the cinematography was great, writing was solid, and the show is a little deeper then what I was expecting and I hope the continue to search the characters and truly make this a top tier Marvel series.

Sometimes they can beat and handle a God like they're children, but sometimes they seem like they wouldn't be able to stop a shoplifter. I enjoyed the finale only because of it's implications for the future of the MCU, not because it was well written or executed. I found it at times clumsy and overly ambitious, with arbitrary solutions to seemingly impossible problems. As much as I love the MCU, I wish they would cut down on the number of new shows, and focus on maintaining quality. Overall, they're still good, but they could be better.

Characters: Loki is very disappointing. What the marvel universe set Loki up as was a clever mastermind. Now he's a dim witted, slow to action, average jo.

His character is emotionally unstable, and cheesy. He has no real story or drive. And is clearly only here because Disney wanted more money.

Mobius is a fairly descent character. He gets a laugh out of you, and seems to be a authentic person in this universe. His characters soul purpose seems to be expedition for Loki.

She Loki or Sylvia is very horrible. Her character is annoying and massively over powered. Her characters motivation is barely there, her line delivery is awful, and she is purely here because she's female or because they weren't creative enough to think of a story.

Story: this story is astonishingly bad.

It's long, boring, and hard to follow.

The characters don't fit in it, the scenes make no sense and are very cheesy. And it's very choppy when it's not being boring.

Special effects: the fighting is ill choreographed and unentertaining to watch, the animation is fake looking and not creative at all. The music is boring and at times out right annoying.

The implications after episode 6 are just enormous and I m happy that marvel finally kicked it off. That doesn't mean though that this storyline is not filled with HUGE plot holes... I m curious to see how they will patch these up.

However, they need to fix the pace and make this series a bit more energetic in season 2.

Though I'm not going to rate the series yet based on one episode. Hopefully it doesn't turn out like WV or FATWS and keeps up the high quality. Also Loki(character) is the GOAT.

2. The second episode is even better than the first! It pretty much did what episode one did and improved it. I noticed the dialogue was way smoother and wittier. And Tom's acting is phenomenal. Loving where this series is going.

3. Yes the third episode definitely downgraded in quality but giving the whole series a 1 based on that one episode is stupid. The dialogue was not good in this episode and I'm not a fan of the female Loki. But hopefully the fourth episode gets back on track.

4. Marvel you have redeemed yourselves! Way better episode than the last one, well, better than all the episodes so far. So many twists and surprises. Really excited for next episode.

5. Not my favorite episode so far but it is still really good. To me the quality was just like the 2nd episode with a couple better things going it's way. Can't wait for the finale!

6. It's a really good episode but not the greatest finale. I just wished they wrapped some things up a little better, but there is going to be a season 2! Well at least there wasn't some stupid CGI battle.

Okay, overall the series is a fun time and very interesting. It can be a bit confusing to some people, but once you understand everything it's a very entertaining show. Loki(character) is phenomenal. However, he's really the only character I got attached to. Sometimes the dialogue is really good, sometimes it is very subpar. The music is really good and matches the vibe of the show.

And my facial expressions were also pretty straight watching this episode as there was no thrill or even a logical storytelling, I understand it's an aminated show targetted at children maybe? But only those children who are familiar with all the MCU till now might perhaps be able to enjoy it.

Let's see how the rest of the episodes turn out but I am certainly not very excited about them after this one.

Edit : 2nd episode gave the actual feel of what MCU is about, it was creative and thoughtful with major WHAT IF moments. I thoroughly enjoyed watching T'challa back on screen.

However the 3rd episode was deal breaker and made me edit this review. It was so thrilling and exciting to watch, I could have watched a whole movie on this episode. It re explored the characters we know to a level that leaves u wanting for more.

I hope I get to a 10 star edit by the end of the season.

Edit II : Here goes my one more star for a 'strange' yet thought provoking episode which was by far the best among all in terms of writing, voice over, animation and storyline. Special mention for Benedict Cumberbatch for nailing the voice over like a boss. Take a bow Marvel for making this one.

However, coming to 5th episode, the episode was entertaining for sure, it was humorous and engaging with quality animation but again showed too much simultaneously not giving viewers enough time to absorb things.

What If...?,tt10168312,MysticMoonNyx,"Aug 31, 2021",10,What If...I Actually Enjoyed Watching,"The intriguing multiverse stories are interwoven with a refreshing art style that hasn't been overused. Don't be deceived by the trailers-though it may seem like a collection of standalone episodes with alternate scenarios, but there's an overarching storyline that ties previous tales together. While some viewers found this disjointed, I appreciated it. The show occasionally revisits past episodes to ""finish"" a story, which wasn't always necessary but felt rewarding to me. Overall, I enjoyed each episode for its humor, brilliance, underlying meanings, and symbolism.

Season one I rate 9/10. How it all came together in the end was pure brilliance for me. I rewatched it again before starting season two. Dr. Strange's episode is intensely emotional and so well written. It's my favourite one hands down. My next faves would be the first episode with Captain Carter, the zombie one and the last two with Ultron.

Season two I also rate 9/10. I think I might love it slightly more than season one. It was hard picking favourites this time around as I really appreciated all of them, but the introduction of Kahhori in episode six was incredible and my fave. That story was so touching and beautiful. I love how it was done in both a native and Spanish language. I absolutely want to see more of this character in the future. My next faves would be the three with Captain Carter, Hela and the Ten Rings, and finally Happy saving Christmas.

Season three was a bit of a degrade, but still gets an 8/10. I LOVE Agatha and her show, though I wasn't impressed with the episode, which was disappointing. It was still enjoyable and much better than a few others. Darcy and Howard the Duck's episode was chef's kiss. Darcy is a character I have grown to appreciate, and Howard, well he's been a part of my life since childhood so I hold a special place for him in my heart. 1872 was another brilliant episode and was well written. Pairing Shang-Chi and Kate Bishop, (Hawkeye) is one I would have like to see partner up again.

There will be a lot of Marvel fanboys that will absolutely despise What If, but I thought it was well done for what it was. The different scenarios of alternated timeliness was fun to watch, but this was definitely geared more toward Captain Carter's character thoroughout the entirety.

The first episode has Agent Carter becoming Captain Carter, and the episode feels as if someone was describing a movie to me in a rushed manner. Obviously there are references to the original MCU for YouTubers to microanalyze, but it almost comes off as a simple kids show with characters fighting and blowing stuff up.

The show could have had a much better story, because after all, we are dealing with the multiverse here. Instead Captain Carter still returns from the inter dimensional void after 70 years, and has not aged much here ( Tesseract was the space stone, not the time stone right?), Bucky and Steve are dead probably, and Nick Fury and Clint Barton still end up in 2012 working on the Tesseract. The writers must have skimped on the brainstorming part here. And how did WW2 era Stark design the Hydra Stomper so fast? Or how did Red Skull have the portal machine for Tesseract ready and waiting, when just a while back they discovered it?

The animation is good, though the characters reach quite close to the uncanny valley, as you keep comparing them to the live actors. The facial features which look quite good in stills and feature art seem unnatural animated. The charm of the respective actors on screen is lost in this.

"" what is the avengers defeated everybody?""
""what if The alien costume had possessed Spiderman?""
""what if the Hulk had Bruce Banner's brain?""


And on and on it goes. The thing is that these stories were great because they tied directly back to Marvel's original continuity and sometimes ended better, but usually ended more tragically with a twinge of irony.

The only episode I've seen in the series that reflects that vibe so far is the Dr. Strange one. I think it resonates better than all the rest simply because it's based on a choice that we can believe would happen in Stange's continuity. And of course, the results are mind-blowing.

I don't get that same feeling from ""T'challa becomes Starlord,"" because...well, because...or the entire MCU are zombies for no explicable reason. Or that Peggy could've saved Steve best by putting him in a machine that would accelerate his healing. Duh... the Avengers not forming episode was oh-Kay.

There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot.",79,30
What If...?,tt10168312,touhid74,"Dec 30, 2023",4,What if season 2 is all about Peggy Carter?,"I'm sure the pitch meeting for What If Season 2 at Marvel went like this: So, here's our plan for What If Season 2: We will bring back Peggy Carter and have heroes fight their dads in the name of freedom. Because dads are bad and they want to control kids. Then we will have more Peggy Carter. We feel that there are still some strong male characters left, so we will replace them and make every episode focus on even stronger female leads. After that, we will again have Peggy Carter, but in 1602. Finally, we feel that we have not made Doctor Strange weak enough. So we will have him defeated by Peggy Carter.

Like seriously, Marvel, if we want to focus on Peggy Carter this much, you could have just given her a movie or series. And it would have been fine. But instead, you decide to ruin What if. The series has endless possibilities. In every story so far, there have been some key moments where the heroes had to make a choice. All Marvel had to do was pick a story and explore the alternate reality of what it would have been if the hero picked a different path. It's not always going to be the best decision. The outcome might have been negative, and that's the beauty of What if. But Marvel just opted to doubled down on more female leads, predictable happy endings, and Peggy Carter.

I rated the first season of What if: 8/10.

My rating for the second season: 2/10.

First of all, it's painfully obvious Jeremy Renner is collecting a paycheck and doesn't really want to be here. I've rarely seen someone look so ""I'm just here for the money"" with their delivery.

The plot is cookie-cutter, slow, and is of no consequence. Kate is incredibly unlikeable. I feel zero pity for her.

However given a large library of comicbook stories, he definitely could be given depth and a good story woven with interesting characters.

This is not really centered around Hawkeye. It is split between too often overreacting Kate, who it sometimes seems finds people suspicious at a drop of a hat, and always tired and worn Clint. Both are very much stereotypical characters here, a semi-grumpy combat worn hero and a tag-along newbie, who marvels at him and annoys him with ""witty"" quips as they being finding mutual appreciation and respect. Yeah, nothing very original here in any aspect.

Neither is the story. Jack is charismatic and entertaining character played by a good actor however I think we've all seen our share of duplicitous partners and kids who notice things first.

All in all its pretty predictable and all wrapped in a politically correct and woke Disney packaging. It is not bad but neither is it great or original.

Hawkeye,tt10160804,ThunderKing6,"Dec 21, 2021",1,Arrow is still superior,"I almost waited till 3am to watch the last filth episode. I Thank Odin that I didn't,

About: It's a show about nothing.

Story: There is none. It's a show about nothing. Katie goes to an auction and then ends up in Clint's guest bedroom.

Production: The first 2 episodes were good. The rest were bad. There wasn't any villain development. When you think a character is going to get some development, they don't. The Kingpin reveal and showing was lame. Then supposedly he was shot and maybe killed. Maybe not? It was down off-screen. There are so many unanswered questions.

* How did Elaine Benes know Clint Barton ""killed"" Black Widow on Vormir? Who told her this? No one mentioned to anyone she was dead at the end of Endgame. They didn't have a funeral for a reason. So the whole plot of Nastasha's Sister wanting revenge and Elaine telling her about Clint made no sense.

Did The Red Skull return back to earth?

Nastasha's Little sister came to kill Clint or Katie's dad? Which one was it?

*Why does Katie resemble Jessica Jones? Both are pale and have flat glutes.

*Why is she able to take down grown men? She had no superhero field experience. The thugs look like they've been in the streets for decades. These sounded like Russian thugs. In Russian prisons in the movies, Russians are always portrayed as tough, strong and mean. * Why are they portrayed as dumb and weak out of prison?

* Why didn't Nastasha's sister just knock out Katie Bishop in the elevator?

This show isn't even about Katie or the Hawk. It's about nothing. Nothing happens in the middle, and nothing is set up in the end. Nothing. Except for the fact that they allowed a worthless mutt in their home to release parasites or maybe Annihilation.

I think MCU/Disney knows their fanbase is unintelligent. I'm not a fan of anything. When I look at these shows and the ratings/reviews, it can only confirm that MCU/Disney does think their fanbase is dumb. No one except me has the courage to question and criticizes anything about these products.

This show looked lazy. Oh! And the horrible comedy. It should be a crime to call that comedy. In this last episode it was horrible and forced. How to destroy a character (Natasha's little Sister) without literally destroying her; that's by forcing her into silly joke scenes. I have no respect for this character after the elevator scene. She's supposed to be a deadly assassin. * Why doesn't she act like it? * Why is she so nice? Elaine Benes should have hired Agent 47 instead.

Highlight: I like Ronin. And not even Ronin in this filth was a highlight. There is nothing in this show that stood out.

Cliffhanger: Nope. Just Katie is sleeping over at Clint's.

Grossness Level: Katie Bishop still did not earn my respects as a superhero for me. She was rushed and underdeveloped.

Should you watch this show?: No. It's a show about nothing. Nothing happens. No development. Hawkeye in his own show was as useless as when he was fighting alongside THOR. I like Hawkeye but this Hawkeye is not good. Earth Mightest Heroes Hawkeye was the best. They made Hawkeye into a washed-up middle-aged transformer. They disrespected Hawkeye in the MCU. That's why his support base is minimal. My odds of watching anymore of the MCU shows are slim after this showing. I really thought this show would have been par on par with Arrow. MCU you have failed HAWKEYE!

1. Loki: ------------ V 2. Falcon and Bucky:

3. Hawkeye: v v v v v V 4. WandaVision:",124,313

Wandavision was next-gen TV, like watching something from the year 2050. Superman and Lois punches far above its weightclass and was a great countermove from DC. However Marvel, a franchise WHICH HAS KILLED MORE HEROES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAN IT CREATED IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, seems to see Hawkeye as a response to STARGIRL and that does not bode well. Although Hawkeye's budget -- just like Washington's -- has broken all previous records, the writing and action seem a little clunky. Only Renner, an A-lister of enormous poise and presence, seems worth the screen time.",66,292
Hawkeye,tt10160804,briancham1994,"Dec 22, 2021",3,A whole lot of nothing,"This TV show reminds me of an internet skit in the early 2010s that parodied the then-popular wave of Electronic Dance Music. In the skit, a DJ plays a dance track that builds up, raising the energy and tension. The drumbeats get faster, the synths get louder and more instruments get introduced. The dancers await the track's ""drop"", when the music is supposed to peak in energy and enter a new phase. But instead of reaching a resolution, the track just keeps building up, and up, and up - ad infinitum - to the bafflement of everyone in the room.

In the same way, Hawkeye continually adds more plot elements and characters to raise the stakes, but never actually pays off any of them. The first episode set up a story centred around the aging Hawkeye getting involved with an athletic but cocky Kate Bishop. Two major mysteries involve the Rolex watch and the murder of Armand. There's no clear antagonist (beyond hapless Russian gangsters) or ""main point"", but that's okay, because it's only the first episode and the audience can wait for that to be established later.

Problem is, every episode feels like a first episode. Everything keeps getting set up and teased, but nothing of consequence really happens, characters don't progress and plotlines are never resolved. The ""main point"" of the show is Armand's murder, until it's Jack's identity, until it's Maya and her father, until the series briefly turns into The Yelena Belova Show (which would have been infinitely better), until it's back to Eleanor, until it's Kingpin (who is introduced too late for us to care about). The episodes really feel like the writers completely forgot what they had written previously, so storylines are dropped completely and then never picked up until much later. Then, the answers we get are so disappointing - the boring gangsters are just boring gangsters, the swordsman is just a swordsman and the Rolex watch is just a Rolex watch.

Fine, so Marvel stories aren't Shakespeare, and maybe I'm demanding too much. Some would say it's more about enjoying the journey, right? Problem is, there's barely any compelling action or comedy either. The main characters are nearly invincible, which is especially jarring when the extremely petite Hailee Steinfeld routinely beats up armed men over twice her size in overly choreographed and generic fistfights. The injuries she and Hawkeye sustain are a neat way to show human fragility but they are superficial with no real consequence. As for the humour, the show falls back on idiotic LARPers who simply exist to waste screen time.

The show tries to revel in its human, down-to-earth portrayal of superheroes but this is its own undoing. For this style to be compelling, the moments would have to have some gravity or tension for the characters themselves. The actors do the best with the material they have, but they just seem to skip from one random event to another. Kate Bishop looks like a spoiled child who didn't get everything she wanted from Santa, and Hawkeye looks like an old man who has a headache and wants to take a nap. The biggest emotional moment was when Hawkeye was annoyed at having to play with the LARPers to get the Ronin costume back (equally matched by my own annoyance at the pointless scene).

If there's anything I can give the show credit for, I give it one star for Yelena Belova (please just give Florence Pugh her own show and let her improvise the whole thing), one star for the brilliant one-shot car chase scene in Episode 3 (an impressive technical feat reminiscent of Children of Men) and one star for only having six episodes (so I didn't have to watch any more of this).",194,140

Half of them clearly only watched the first 20 minutes of the first episode. I personally believe that Hawkeye delivers exactly what it promises. So many seem to believe that every MCU show or movie has to be at the scale and quality of Endgame now. One review claims that Hawkeye is barely in the show, this is untrue as that just pertains to the first half of the first episode. Another claims that that Kate Bishop should not be skilled in combat or archery but there is an in show explanation for these things. Sometimes I wish that people would actually watch things before they rate them extremely low. I'm not claiming that this is the best MCU show that there is, but I do believe it is definitely not the worst one. To me this show is very refreshing in a time of multiverses colliding and externals protecting the world from universal gods. It has a very simple down to earth approach that reminds us what marvel is about. Not every hero has to spend every day saving the entirety of the universe. Sometimes it's nice to see a hero take on a small group of villains in just one city. I really don't understand how you can hate something that you seen 1/6th of. If you are hesitant about this series because of the negative reviews, don't be. I honestly believe this show is one of the better ones on Disney plus as far as Marvel goes.

Using the name Hawkeye was just to try and get fans of an established character to watch their new show. This is clearly a show about Kate Bishop and Hawkeye will be a side character. I had a hard time getting through just these two episodes. I found myself skipping ahead at times just because I was bored of all the talking that had nothing to do with anything.

Anyways, as it is, this show sucks. It is the worst piece of crap in phase 4 to date. I don't know if it will improve but I'm not sure I can watch another episode to find out. I mean, it's be two full episodes and absolutely NOTHING has happened! So I really doubt that it will get any better. Save yourself the time and watch anything else.",93,91

Moon Knight,tt10234724,lusciousmuffins,"Mar 29, 2022",3,Yikes!,"I did not expect this to be great or even good, but it did surprise me with regards to the ways in which it was bad.

First and foremost, it was painful to watch Oscar Isaac struggle with a British accent.

I always thought of him as a decent actors, but he was so clearly uncomfortable trying to affect the accent that is made me uncomfortable.

Next, of course, was the very lackluster story development, which seems to be Disney's signature these days.

Compounding that was the very poor dialogue; even the casual banter was awkward and stilted.

Alas, the other problem was treatment of the hero.

The insistence on denigrating certain people and exalting others based purely on immutable traits like gender, race, and sexuality is impossible to ignore.

Ironically, it also has the opposite of its intended effect.

That is to say, the fact that the writers are trying to hard to shoehorn in certain ideologies is painful obvious and therefore rings false.

Consequently, instead of liking the characters you are being pushed to idolize, you end up disliking them, in this case, intensely.

One thing that saves a lot of Disney's Marvel offerings was absent from Moon Knight, humor.

The comedic elements that typically make these increasingly generic superhero shows somewhat tolerable was almost non-existent in this show.

Certainly attempts were made to inject mirth, but they failed, which in turn made watching this a very joyless experience.

In the end, all that was left to recommend Moon Knight were the sets and costumes.

Disney does not skimp when it comes to the look of its shows and films, so you do get visual interest.

Still, if I want to look at something pretty, I'd rather spend my time at an art museum where the creations have something Moon Knight sorely lacks: soul.

If certain characters and situations are not written, as well as certain dialogues, the series or film will not be funded. That's why most movies and shows today are predictable and tedious.

It might be a lot more interesting, but unfortunately, this is just another in a series of boring and predictable mediocre productions. Oscar Isaac is a good actor, but it's just weird to hear him speak with a British accent. It doesn't sound bad, but it does sound like a parody at times.

This by itself is not a problem, but it take away a bit for us adults looking to have a bit more serious entertainment. The second issue is that that the overarching story is a bit thin and there is nothing tangible as far as villain's or big bad or big obstacle goes. Each individual episode is far better than the show as a whole. I gave almost all episodes a 9/10, but the show I will only give a 8/10.

The production value is very high, cinematography great, Music outstanding, set pieces and scenes fantastic and acting is so much better in this show than any other Disney plus Marvel show that everyone over at Marvel should take notes.

Huge plus also for the big cameo in the finale.

A lot of the visual stuff was excellent, including the use of surrounding signs to show the contents of text conversations, which was visually more interesting than just showing the texts, and many more small details.

The edits and transitions were well done.

All the characters were well-rounded and distinct, you can identify with all of them... Except for the main character, who is just 2 dimensional garbage.

Every character was distinct and watchable, and with any other protagonist this show might have gone well. Unfortunately the protagonist was written to be an annoying self-obsessed garbage person.

So, the protagonist and whole point and focal point of the show was weakly written, irritating, a pushover, and whiny. Not the most compelling character.

Also I'm not sure how Captain Marvel can be the favourite Avenger of anyone in the MCU.

Not just the main character either, but there was a whole Captain Marvel cosplay competition with a number of competitors.

There was also no indication there was a contest for cosplaying any other MCU character, no indication the Captain Marvel was only one of the cosplay competitions like for any of the Avengers people within the MCU would have heard of.

Carol Danvers was only on Earth for 5 minutes in the 90's before Khan was born, and which probably wasn't made public, and as I recall from that terrible movie, did nothing in the modern era because she was written to be so strong in her own movie that she couldn't do anything ever again as whichever movie the smirking jerk appears in would end in 5 minutes.

So, the premise is flawed, the main character is unwatchable, and she is the whole point of the show. As establishing her, the family dynamic, and then origin storying her powers.

Don't get me wrong - I can still enjoy re-watching The Breakfast Club, Stand by Me, Donnie Darko, Ferris Bueller, and many others! It's possible to write characters who are teens, seeing the world through pubescent perspectives, and still draw in both adults and current teens.

The pilot of this show didn't do that.

It seemed too caught up in the banal trappings of teen life, from posting fan-kid videos, to not being able to go out to a beloved event because of repressive parents. These are, in themselves, largely banal tropes. A story needs to add something NEW to the mix. This show reminded me of my concerns with the way Turning Red began. However, there were some rich and unique aspects to that environment which left me hanging in, plus some comedic aspects to the overbearing mom archetypical character. Yet that movie quickly moved into some new territory and became interesting, despite being very teen-centric. Plus it dared touch on themes often taboo for family flicks.

I'll hold out hope that future episodes of Ms. Marvel will become more engaging, but I'm disappointed this pilot episode spent so much time in banality.

Not to say it wasn't without charms. I liked some of the animated art a la augmented reality. Problem is - it didn't connect enough with the character. We're meant to think it is a product of the main character's imagination, since they seemed to circulate around her, but this was more inference than portrayal. In some scenes, it was difficult to determine if she was highly creative and artistic, or whether she was ADD, or just a product of the short-attention-span cell phone generation. I'll add they made the dad potentially the most interesting character, with a couple attempts at humor and humanity. We'll have to see.

I also liked the main actress. She seemed personable, and maybe if she's given more to work with, she can shine.

The writer's explain Jen's superiority to Bruce with this logic: she has had to deal with more stress than Bruce because she's a woman, and therefore she can control her emotions better. Really? Being a woman is more stressful than fighting to save the world and the universe multiple times against alien and godlike foes, losing your friends and your true love without getting to say goodbye, and being responsible for the safety and sometimes the great harm you can cause to the innocents around you, all while having been constantly warring with a violent alternate personality, for 15 years?

I don't mind if the writers make her better at being a Hulk than Bruce, I would just like to see ONE legitimate reason why that's the case. Give her more background, give her more motivation, give her some development, give her something other than a smug smirk and a snarky quip followed by Banner acting like an idiot. You can do that without demeaning and lowering an established and well developed male character. If you have to put down a man to make a woman appear stronger, then you're presenting the false idea that in order for a woman to be stronger the man has to be incompetent. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. You can make a woman character stronger than a male one, just as you can make any character stronger than another, but for good green god's sake put a little effort into the writing to make it make sense.",1.6K,927

I have all of the She-Hulk comic runs from Savage She-Hulk #1 to the present day run currently sold in your comic shops at the time this Disney+ show released. She is one of my favorite Marvel women and ought to be treated with high respect while having a lot of fun. But the MCU failed to capture the charm, fun, and heart of the lovely green lawyer from the comics. This show suffers from the same problems that the MCU Phase 4 has...it doesn't know what it wants to be, it has rejected its former audience that made it an epic success for an entirely imagined one instead, and it doesn't know where it is going. Specifically in She-Hulk: Attorney-at-Law's case, it did not flesh out the characters well-enough to make the audience care. Who are these supporting cast members? Why are they so one-dimensional? Why should I care? Where are all the actual jokes? The parts where Jen is actually trying to be a lawyer for superheroes or talking in a court scene are the funniest, but in too many other areas it tries too hard to be funny. Some people will watch this show and never laugh even where it is trying to tell a joke, which is rough because this is supposed to be a comedy. It is too bad the insecurities of the writers were projected into Jen Walters. While the pot shots and zingers may make them feel vindicated in this world, it will most likely turn off audience members or just make them roll their eyes. The best advice I could give is remember and respect your audience, respect your characters, make things interesting, know where to start, go, and stop, and finally have some fun.

Walters came across as obnoxious, vacuous and full of herself. There was no effort made at all towards character development in the first episode which looks like a poorly crafted music video from the 90s.

The first episode obviously serves as a placeholder for more shlock. This show is trying to be sex and the city with a pg13 rating and female Shrek.

Marvel's idea of setting up strong female characters with exposition dumps instead of focusing on having them go through a journey to realize their true potential.

Mediocre shows like Miss Marvel and now She Hulk which should in fact be called 'The Abomination' or She Shrek: Attorney at Yawn.. should just not be allowed to see daylight.

At the end of the first episode I could feel the bile at the back of my throat and a haunting realization that Marvel has officially run out of ideas.

So its basically running on fumes now. The way she gains her powers is a joke and the way she 'overcomes' the cons of being a Hulk is so laughable and indigestible that I have been having digestion pills since I saw the episode today.

First off, I don't think this show is intentionally bad. The characters are quirky and likeable, and there are good attempts of humor that might have landed if it didn't try so hard. There are also several moments of easter eggs and references that I found charming in an MCU product. The showrunners clearly had a goal of Aly Mcbeal meets super heroes then it takes a bizarre left turn in to degrading other super heroes.

The problem, however, is in the execution. The story is just messy. Jennifer just like appears in Bruce's life, for the past decade he's been this nomad type with no real personal attachment to any one (except Black Widow). Addressing the elephant in the room though the CGI of every character hurts a lot of feelings and very unnecessary. The actress Malia Arrayah got the most raw deal, so she is the foundation of the ""she-hulk"" design. But she's deep faked and altered instead of doing a Ferrigno and its hard to watch.",500,833

Can we please just get one of the terrible Marvel shows with a straight white male lead, so we can shut up about people hating women or people with dark skin?

The show isn't funny, it's not exciting, it's not emotional, it doesn't seem to have a useful message, so what's left at that point. Are there so many people out there, that can watch a boring unfunny show, just because it so amazing to have a female feminist superhero on screen?

The 4th wall breaking seems completely out of place and isn't used for anything other than repetitive exposition, so it just comes off as cringy.

Tatiana Maslany is a great actress and she's not unlikable in this show, she just doesn't have much to work with. If the best the writers can come up with is a joke about her falling off a chair, then you could have put Meryl Streep in the lead an still not have anything to show for it.

Honestly Marvel, hand the TV shows back to the people who did the Netflix shows.

Two episodes in, there are barely any action set pieces. This seems to be a recurring problem with recent Disney+ shows set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are passable but, still questionable. Especially when it comes to She-Hulk's performance capture CGI. The humor is a bit hit and miss. This is not ideal because She-Hulk: Attorney at Law is classified as the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first legal comedy. Tatiana Maslany is the star of the show as Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk. Maslany effortlessly carries the show on her shoulders, with her spectacular performance. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Bruce Banner/Smart Hulk. Maslany & Ruffalo's banter & camaraderie, is the highlight of the show. Ginger Gonzaga is brilliant as Nikki Ramos. Jameela Jamil is perfect as Titania. Tim Roth is excellent as Emil Blonsky/Abomination. It's exciting to see Roth reprise his role, 14 years after The Incredible Hulk(2008). The supporting cast is memorable.

Please just read my review, I was going in this show with low expectations but I have reasons to my rating I put here. *I'll explain why it dropped a little as well*

Let's just start by saying I had my hopes very low for this show. I think wandavision and loki have been the highest points of this MCU and hawakeye/Falcon/moonknight we're okay.... Ms marvel kind of was disappointing so I didn't really know where this MCU show would go after.

Then in comes She-hulk, started off a little too fast for my taste, kind of rushes into things, but I feel once we get the full scope of how she gets these powers it's really nice to see it unfold afterwords.

Also let me say the EFFECTS ARE AWESOME. Ms marvel had some garbage effects and I wasn't too convinced when I saw the trailer to this, they looked very weird. But based on the first episode these effects were very nice. I think she Hulk looks fine in CGI and the effects are just well done for a TV show. Let's be honest it can be worse like CW.

I feel like they did put a lot of attention to the show but some things they didn't really focus on which is disappointing like who she hulk TRULY is as a person and why she wants to endure this stuff. Sure she kinda has no choice because she didn't ask to have these powers but I want to know what drives her... (again, this review can change if the show gets better or expands upon this)

*went down a bit because it just kept getting lost in its own merit, just not that funny becomes uninteresting, and just very degrading at times, felt like a chore, sucks because I thought the pilot was fine, it wasn't the best but I liked the dynamic between him and her and I thought it would be more of that, but she hulk alone just can't hold this show together at all, and the cheesy comedy doesn't help it at all.",347,642

If Hulk blod is so dangerous it needs to be destroyed, even when they are in human blod, wouldn't that mean She hulk should be locked up once a month ? As not only is blood a threat in case somebody gets it to make something out of, just being around it is enough to give you a lethal dose of radiation, there is no way she isn't triggering all radiation sites all the time, she would be a hassard to nuclear defense just walking around.

Not to mention if she ends up having sex with anyone they are going to get killed by cancer, so she would be committing a murder really.

And the blood just needs to touch you it seems, or did the writers for get a wound isn't a 2 way street for blood, as there is pressure pushing out of a wound to make sure as little as possible gets in, other blood even less so.

Then there is all this trouble with her being a mary sue, she can do it all in less time than a weekend last. So there is no journey or hardship involved in this, as she only got the up side of it all, there is a joke about woman having it easier than men right here I guess.

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,tt10857160,rannynm,"Aug 21, 2022",9,"An Adrenaline-Fueled, Adventurous Journey That Jumps Into Action From the Get Go!","She-Hulk: Attorney at Law is a series that jumpstarts into action. It's an adrenaline-fueled, adventurous journey that ties into Marvel superhero movies. The series tells the engaging story about a lawyer who might lose her job due to some very interesting conditions.

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law features Jennifer Walters, an attorney living in Los Angeles. Jen happens to be the cousin of Bruce Banner (the Hulk). Unexpectedly, Jen and Bruce got into a car crash. After the crash, some of Bruce's blood got into Jen's wounds, which caused her to transform into an adapted version of the Hulk-hence, the name She-Hulk.

The main characters in this series are She-Hulk (Jennifer Walters), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Nikki Ramos (Ginger Gonzaga), Titania (Jameela Jamil) and Abomination (Tim Roth). These actors impersonate their characters incredibly well. Additionally, the sets and animation are extremely realistic. When there is a fight, the animation made my heart beat super fast. In the first episode, my favorite part is when Bruce is training Jen to learn how to control the intense amount of strength she has. After demonstrating how to throw boulders, for example, she adapts quickly, and sometimes even does the exercise better than the Hulk himself. I also appreciate the quote when Bruce proclaims that what triggers turning into a hulk is anger and fear, and Jen responds, ""Those are like the baseline of any women existing."" It's hilarious and also true. I would recommend watching previous Marvel movies, especially the ones that include the Hulk. However, it's not a necessity, although it would help knowing the backstory of how hulks were created.

The message of this series is that females can be strong, too. I believe that the ""She-Hulk"" nickname isn't merely random, but has a meaning to it, which is female empowerment. Furthermore, this series establishes that women's emotions are normal, and that it is okay to have strong feelings, including anger. There is a lot of fighting and violence, and it has rough language. If young kids have seen other Marvel movies with parent/guardian approval, they should be fine watching this series.

She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,tt10857160,bluejacket-08230,"Aug 17, 2022",2,"Messy, Unfunny, Cringe, Over Doing It","Basically. The CGI ruins the show. The lead actress was GREAT in Orphan Black she can definitely play other personalities well but she just feels watered down thanks to the Disney/Marvel cringe comedy influence. Kinda like how they wasted Christian Bale in Love and Thunder. She should have been used in a MCU movie 5 years ago before they changed the formula. I really couldn't make it passed the first episode. I literally got 27 minutes in before I just decided to tune out. I came here to write my review instead. Maybe if Disney pays me to finish it then I'll get it a good review haha.

But yeah, this show definitely is a sign that the MCU needs to go on Hiatus for about 4 years. Come out with Wakanda Forever in November and just announce it's time for a break. It won't happen obviously because Disney and Kevin Feige will milk it all dry but by 2027 the MCU will be so burnt out it'll be nothing but a fever dream. It's the healthier option at this point. It's time for the audience and fans to invest in different hobbies. This show just wasn't watchable and isn't really adding anything new to the MCU that fans haven't seen within the movies. They massacred Hulk even though the MCU has been doing that for years. It's honestly really unfortunate what they've done to him. I give this show a hard pass and I have absolutely no interest in continuing it.",351,593
She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,tt10857160,Tastentier,"Aug 19, 2022",8,Still needs to find its footing but it's off to a decent start,"A legal comedy with superhero elements that is not only told from a female perspective but actually written and directed by women is a bold new direction for Marvel. Of course it'll take a few episodes for this show to hit all the right notes, especially with an episode length of 30 minutes that doesn't allow for a lot of plot development. But the first episode wasn't bad at all and I'm confident they'll work out the minor kinks.

One such kink is the CGI, which isn't entirely up to MCU movie standards. It's not as bad as CGI Luke in season 2 of The Mandalorian but the facial expressions don't feel completely natural. I've seen a few text-to-facial-animation solutions and the expressions look very similar here, as if they were software-animated rather than motion-captured. It's probably a budget limitation. Other than that, my only complaint is the runtime. The plot feels rather condensed in this half-hour format.

Now for the elephant in the room that has the self-appointed anti-wokeness police REEEEEEing at the top of their lungs. The superhero genre is a power fantasy, and for once it's not about a Billy Batson who stumbles across a wizard and immediately gains the combined powers of all the Greek gods and heroes. Or an orphaned tween who becomes the sidekick of none other than Batman and learns in record time how to beat up adult criminals twice his size. Or a teenager who suddenly develops mutant powers, finds a Nova Corps helmet, etc. Pp. You get the picture.

Point being, this is a power fantasy by and for women. It should come as no surprise that it involves a lot of the things women have to put up with on a daily basis. Such as condescending men who assume women couldn't possibly naturally excel at anything, especially not to the point of surpassing men.

Being surprisingly great at something is the whole point of a power fantasy. Hal Jordan comes into possession of a Green Lantern ring, everybody on Oa doubts that a primitive human could do the job, but he proves everyone wrong as he quickly surpasses his teachers and it doesn't take long before he single-handedly saves Earth and Oa and the entire universe. But when a woman so much as masters emotional self-control faster than her cousin Bruce did, everyone loses their expletive minds to quote Nolan's Joker. Even when it's true to the comic books, where Jennifer also retained her persona and intellect in Hulk form.

Bottom line: I think female Marvel fans will love this show. As a male fan I realize that it wasn't made exclusively for my demographic but I still find it very enjoyable. MCU Bruce was always a bit dorky and I really don't feel he's getting an unfair or uncharacteristic treatment here. I can't wait to see where Kat Coiro, Jessica Gao et al are taking the MCU's latest offering.",239,601

Right, so the CGI is kinda a meh, seems a bit rushed but I can forgive (well not all of it) that as the story seems to be fast paced, you know it literally is boom, pow, bang!

I liked the 4th wall breaks, I found it engaging more with us as the audience. However, even though the story is fast paced, it seems rushed, so basically it's a fast story but it's not developed well, it felt empty and no emotions really went into the story telling, especially at the end when her story changed because well she wanted it to. Even though she changed the story it still was like okay...this isn't really that good it still felt empty.

There were so many cameos every week that only changed the story slightly and even then I still found the show bland. I think if they showed her to have more emotions not just sarcastic remarks and rage moments then I think it would've made the story much better.

The comical moments in the show were good, I think that was good idea for the show to have some humourous scenes, it helped show that Jen isn't just a Hulk, she can be funny to, a funny cool Jen.

It would've been nice to see her with her family more and maybe show that yes she is tough but she has a strong bond with her famy instead of the almost teenager attitude that Jen had around them, to me that seemed unnecessarily awkward.

It's a cool show, I just didn't think it was a necessary show that needed to happen that would change things in the MCU. Well, I could be wrong, it might be a massive change, who knows? We will have to wait and see.",291,546

The use of black and white combined with the added film grain and cigarette burns is really impressive and enhances the experience. It also really helps it standout in an increasingly crowded and overly familiar universe.

This show is a cheap knock off of old horror classics, expendable characters, cheap laughs, weak FX, the werewolf looked like a hairy piglet, filming in black and white to cover gore is laughable and so Disneyish.

If this was supposed to be an homage to old horror classics I think it's yet another fail, it looked more like mockery or caricaturesque.

All this hype for something so mediocre surely makes me nervous about humanity's future.

Whatever happened to original stories? Good, solid stories? Good movie making? Is it extinct? Perhaps.

Werewolf By Night,tt15318872,gareth-75442,"Oct 11, 2022",9,"Gah! People do your homework, this is comic accurate ""Werewolf by Night"" & ""Man-Thing""","A simple Google search of these characters will present the various editions of the 70s Marvel comics and will show how comic accurate the Werewolf & Man-Thing are, Elsa Bloodstone is another matter, her character wasn't created until 2001 and although her tough nature and fighting skills are evident she looks nothing like her various depictions from the comics, neither the big busted scantily clad blonde version or the big busted red haired rifle toting version.

All in all this Halloween special was excellent, entertaining and most of all it introduces these characters into the MCU, each character has played a part of the wider Marvel comics storylines since their introductions and have been alongside or fought against the myriad of Marvels more popular superheroes.

Criticism of Werewolf by night's appearance is in itself ridiculous as the character was based on Lon Chaneys version of the Wolfman and apart from more recent artistic choices by some artists the character has always been depicted as a Wolfman and not as a version of a full blown Werewolf depicted in various movies from the past few decades.

Man-Thing was an excellent addition to this special and a fantastic surprise, all thanks to Kevin Feige's suggestion the character be included, both characters have a long history together in the comics, more importantly, apart from a brief cameo in Dr Strange 2 this is the 1st time Man-Thing has been seen on screen since the 2005 Man-Thing movie,a low budget monster movie loosely based on the characters comic origin that depicts the character as a monster rather than the monster-super-hero of the comics.

Hopefully this one off special will lead to more appearances by these fantastic characters.",83,17
Werewolf By Night,tt15318872,burnzyburns,"Oct 7, 2022",3,A Nothing Special Presentation,"As a casual viewer of Marvel movies and TV shows, I was persuaded by the trailer to see Werewolf By Night. I thought Marvel was going to jump on a different wagon and pay homage to classic monsters from Universal, however that didn't really happen.

I didn't see much appeal here. I thought right from the very beginning to the end, this picture was a complete snooze fest. The plot is basic and unoriginal, the writing lacked craftsmanship (and requires subtitles because everyone is speaking gibberish folklore), and the putrid Marvel comic relief still found its way in this mess of a feature. A lot of what happened was crammed, and there's no attachment with any characters. About 25 mins alone is action and fighting, typical to Marvel standards. It's extremely redundant by this point and it's hardly executed to an exciting level.

The main piece is the man turning into the Werwolf, hence that's what the lead up is all about. If I am to say I was breathtaken by his transformation, then call me a liar. It was done so quick that it just blends in with the rest of the movie. For contrast, Pete Wentz' blood sucking Vampire personality transformation from the A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More Touch Me (Touch Me) music video was pulled off MUCH better, and I'm sure the budgets don't have any comparison. They also could've done some research on Bigby Wolf and carbon copied his progressive transition into The Wolf and payed off the copyright infringements to rack up a bigger budget for The Wolf Among Us 2.

On a side note, I'm not sure if the main character was made to pay tribute to the legendary actor, Boris Karloff, his makeup looked very similar to Karloff's from The Mummy.

On another side note, I'm sure if Elsa were to slowly unzip her jacket and pulled a circle pit belly dance then that would've had Ed Wood coming out of his grave and Tim Burton strongly considering another Ed Wood tribute movie to the late director.

I love the hybrid feel of 80' Halloween special meets old black and white monster movie. It has a little intentional camp and cheese to it which actually works for the genre crossing and it spares us the excessive comedy the MCU is fond of shoving down our throats in every single thing they do lately. This one is stylish and entertaining and paced just right for its just under one hour run time. If for no other reason those who enjoyed the old late 70's early 80's Halloween specials on network tv should check this out as a nice throwback to that era. It is fun without relying on being FUNNY every moment. Please stick with this formula a little more and let a darker side of the MCU thrive as an alternative to the mainstream materials which have become so cookie cutter and joke oriented.

First of all, the music composer turn director Micharl Giacchino showed weakness in many areas.

For Marvel this is a much needed win after bad storylines like that of She-Hulk.

Great cast and acting, Laura Donnelly and Gael García Bernal are perfect for their roles, music underscored everything perfectly and the fact that it was in black and white didn't take away from it, but rather added to the charm.

Werewolf By Night,tt15318872,aheartofdorkness,"Oct 6, 2022",9,Bark At The Moon,"Marvel Comics has published a lot of stories across many genres over the years. In the 1970's, Horror was becoming popular again. The genre had mostly died out in the previous decade after parents had forced publisher EC Comic out of business. They believed that ECs series ""Tales From The Crypt"", as well as others like it, had ""corrupted"" the young with its depiction of violence and gore.

This era of Marvel gave us characters like BLADE (3 movies 2 of which are good), MORBIUS (one movie that is baffling in it badness), MAN-THING (an awful television movie most don't even know exists) and WEREWOLF BY NIGHT. It is the latter that takes center stage in this entry into the scarier side of the MCU.

I really enjoyed this. It pays visual and tonal homage to the classic Universal Monster series with some ramped up action sequences. There were some very cool death scenes and lots of blood, but seeing as how the entire special is in black and white, it is just splatters of tar black spewing about.

I probably would have given it a 4 out of 10 but had to go low to balance out the fake 10 stars.

The main complaint is that it was utterly boring. There's like 5 minutes of 'action' at the end of the movie and 45 minutes of boring time filling dialogue that pretty much adds nothing to what you're watching. The director also seems to have confused black and white with dark, overall the lighting was very poor.

As the other honest reviews have alluded to, the werewolf is also pretty poor, easily one of the worst costumes I've seen in any horror film ever and I've seen a lot. They've also decided to head down the same path as hulk with him, instead of some savage uncontrollable creature, he's sentient, shows empathy and makes good life decisions.. cute. Don't want the little children to be too frightened now do we.

Werewolf By Night,tt15318872,troyarogers,"Oct 7, 2022",1,Did I watch the same movie?,"Werewolf by night is just another Marvel Disney+ venture. Very BAD cgi, the plot would be entirely forgettable if not for its brief runtime, and dialogue is extremely uninteresting after the opening scene, and fight choreography is goofy - the female lead uses the same moves as black widow.

The characters: the hunters are all pretty interesting but are never fleshed out. Furthermore, the actors portraying them clearly did have a lot of energy going into the production but are still not given enough screen time. The main protagonist can keep the momentum going with his relaxed and strikingly innocent demeanor, which is the only positive I can give this films pacing. Worst of all is the lead actress, Elsa, who is given just enough backstory to really help her character shine but is unfortunately held back by run of the mill Marvel female protagonist tropes they've been doing for years, I mean almost every lead woman in Marvel these days acts and does exactly the same; she's a total badass and needs to constantly remind us in every line, in every delivery of a line, in every bit of dialogue she has. The flaring of the eyes as she makes quip and joust in response to almost every scenario, the ""you no nothing about me"" speeches, and of course the obnoxious ways she fights by doing cartwheels and other full body tricks while somehow managing to dodge strikes whilst doing the same wrapping of her legs around peoples heads to before throwing them. Here's a thought Marvel, why not just have your female fighters pick their fists up and fight in a realistic manner that actually shows skill and technique rather than giving us the wwe takedowns that wouldn't work in real life. Anyway I digress, onto the next topic.

The humor: as Marvel is most known for these days, this movie makes attempts to get you to chuckle every now and then, and while it's not as overdone and is also much more subtle than their most recent films and shows, it is still just as stale and at times annoying as ever. The scene where the protagonist has an explosive device and stupidly activates it on accident then has to find a spot on a wall in which to use, once he finds a spot he proceeds to make brainless decision after brainless decision in a scene that is completely annoying as it is unfunny and will likely remind you of watching an episode of Dora the explorer when she can't see something that's directly in front of her then tasks the viewers (children) to help her out, but again I digress.

The action: Marvel. It's just Marvel. Admittedly cool at some parts, it's mostly just cgi effects and and half assed kung fu baked into it. Ultimately as forgettable as pretty much all the fighting is in these movies.

The homage: the biggest appeal for me, as I am a gigantic fan of the classic Universal monsters, I own all the movies across a multitude of physical collection (I am always keeping an eye open for new additions to Universal's vault series), and I mostly rebuilt my collection digitally as well. I honestly did not know how to feel about a 4k modern camera with just a film filter slapped onto it post production, and to be honest I am not too crazy about it. Indeed it would have been passable or at least forgivable had this outing been better but because of how much I disliked it as a whole, the effect leaves an even worse taste in my mouth. Set design was great, it really did seem like another fan of the classics was behind it, but it just wasn't enough to hold this whole mess of a thing together. That's really where the homage ends too sadly as everything else just feels like generic tropes of both modern horror and action. I, as a serious fan of what this movie advertised itself as homage too, do not think that it succeeds in bringing the spirit of the greats back from the dead. Some filters and being displayed in black and white are not enough, instead this came off as someone who has never seen the old macabre movies would imagine they'd look, despite the better set pieces.

Pros: It's short.

Cons: characters, dialogue, action, cgi.

It is not shocking nor gory enough to draw in a casual modern audience (it's not even the goriest Marvel movie) and it certainly fails at delivering the call back to horror of yore as it intended too, leaving fans of such to be disappointed. It doesn't even fit in the horror genre despite the themes it presents, coming off like another boring and bland attempt by the studio to expand its branding.",16,39

Kevin Bacon fits in perfectly, more than ready to indulge in the silliness and send up.

James Gunn's direction is excellent, it has more in common with his direction on Peacemaker and Super than the previous films and returns the MCU to a practical and lived in feel not properly seen since phase 1, which nicely counterbalances the shoddy CG.

I really appreciate that for the special, Star Lord isn't the main character. This special was a perfect way to give other characters more of a spotlight and in this case it was Mantis.

One minor issue I had in GOTG2 was that Mantis was more of a joke character who was not remotely as cool as her comic counterpart. The special finally gives us a Mantis that is more competent which was great. Additionally, we get to see more of Drax's ability as well. Unfortunately, Mantis and Drax are still treated as idiotic characters which is a shame. While Mantis is slightly forgivable because she actually has a serious dilemma and aim but Drax is just really dumb and I really want him to be more serious in GOTG3.

They are treating their audience like a bunch of idiots.

This has nothing interesting, it is not funny, it doesn't leave you with a wholsome feeling. It is forty two long long minuts of nothing.

There is no fantasy, nothing new, nothing cool. Cheap! I wonder how they could agree to make that ""thing"" and destroy the movie with such a cheap production.

They are nice in the way we know them, not in becoming boring driftwood people. They might have a business together as vol.2 started, but they are solo players doing crazy stuff.

I don't understand where people get off giving this short film a 9 or a 10 it really makes no sense, are the majority trying to tell me this was better then the Guardians movies? Are people high?

Anyways lets review.

I think it was good to get some screen time on Drax and Mantis, there awkward synergy together is always good for some laughs, giving them the helm even tho for only 40 minutes definitely gave there characters a boost. This movie also has a decent little Christmas ring to it, wasn't the biggest fan of the music but I respect how they went about it. As something that was definitely out of its comfort zone its not a bad watch.

In saying that some of the jokes dont really hit the mark and some of the dialogue is kinda bland, also there is no forgiveness for what ever the hell they did to Groot, the CGI and animation for him was horrible.

Besides Groot and a little bit of necessary nit picking this special is fine, fair to say its enjoyable and entertaining, is a nice little tease before Vol. 3 comes out... If you try to make out this xmas special is some sort of masterpiece you are bonkers. 6/10 on the dot.",27,23

Neither's terrible, and at least they don't take up as much time as the Disney+ shows (I've given up on those, because they always feel simultaneously overlong and under-developed).

But I like the Guardians of the Galaxy, and seeing this was written and directed by James Gunn made me hopeful. It doesn't have the same kind of consistent humor or entertainment value that the first two movies have, but the characters themselves are at least better here than they were in their woeful Love & Thunder extended cameo.

The premise about kidnapping Kevin Bacon is probably funnier than the execution. Overall, it's disappointing that the jokes here were so hit-and-miss. There are funny moments, but there are also some really awkward and unfunny moments. The more heartfelt moments fare a little better, but I'm also not that crazy about Christmas, so it'll naturally appeal more to those who are, and probably be more emotional as a result.

In 2019 when I first watched Captain Marvel and saw how they butchered Skrulls in there, I already knew Marvel just ruined one of their best storylines and there was no salvaging it.

Secret Invasion is one of the most interesting and somewhat complicated comic storylines I've seen. I haven't read the comics but The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes' Secret Invasion storyline was enough to convince me how good this story is and how mind-blowing and intense a live-action of it would be.

But Disney Plus, like the trash-making machine it is, unsurprisingly took it and made one of the most boring and uninteresting pieces of you know what with it just like every other MCU show it has crapped out in the past couple of years.

But I understand that a storyline on this scale couldn't've been done in the main MCU films because it would be so hard to pull off and also having the Infinity War Saga would make it difficult to incorporate the story in there. I understand that they don't have the budget to bring more actors from the MCU in here, even though it had a movie-level budget of over $200M. And it is then fair to review the show based on its story and not what other story it should've been. The problem is, the new story of this show is just soooo bland and boring and they don't even care about doing anything interesting with it.

If I had to talk about the problems of this show, this review would go on for paragraphs after paragraphs and IMDb's word limit is only 10000 characters, so I make a list of pros and cons instead.

The bad:

















































Now what I liked about it





And yeah, that's it!

I wouldn't say this show is necessarily worse than Ms. Marvel even though I gave that a 5, but I give it lower because I didn't expect much from Ms. Marvel and got a mid show. With this show however, I am aware of what a good storyline they butchered and I give it an even lower score.

If you have unfortunately seen every MCU show up to this point like me, then it really shouldn't be a surprise to you that this show is another Disney Plus trash with terrible writing.

I would recommend you start away from this hot garbage and go watch The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes instead. It's way better than anything MCU has done, at least on Disney Plus maybe and you'll see what a missed opportunity it was for them with having that Captain Marvel script.

I just cannot imagine having billions of dollars and burning them on these shows that aren't even for die-hard Marvel and MCU fans, let alone a casual audience. I cannot fathom someone actually enjoying this and think it's well-written. But I guess if the subscriptions keep coming, why stop making the mid shows, right?",404,55

Disney Marvel's Secret Invasion is a convoluted mess. The writing is beyond unimaginative, without skill or talent, and often contradicts itself in the same scene.

And, the higher ups who greenlit this abomination should have their glasses checked or the dosage on their prescriptions changed... maybe both!

The main villain is introduced with no context as his character is just starring at you smirking. Emilia Clarke has great charisma but again she has such poor lines it's painful to watch. She goes from one place to another and that's about it. Even as a first episode it doesn't create any context, sense of threat or atmosphere.

On top of that the action scenes are extremely slow, ""Book Of Boba Fett"" level of slow, and boring as you guess who's a Skrull most of the time. And was the soundtrack also created by AI? It's so generic, badly dramatic and all over the place like a cheap thriller from the 2000s.

But how do they take a fantastic story by Brian Michael Bendis & make a bland boring TV show? Here's how, by deviating from the storyline & drastically reimaging it.

Secret Invasion director Ali Selim was even told not to read the comics as it was not part of the series.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed that Secret Invasion would not match the scope of the comic book storyline.

Feige also stated that they are not fully exploring the comic story.

He did, however, want to keep a theme from the comic storyline that ties into the events that happened with the Blip, political paranoia, Secret Invasion will be dealing with a more grounded plot compared to the more heroic shows.

So there it is Feige says they're doing a god awful boring TV show because they basically didn't want to do the exciting action packed thriller that was in the comics.

The Secret Invasion story in the comics is very complex with its numerous amounts of superheroes, Skrull, variants of Super-Skrull, and so on. The comic storyline of Secret Invasion focuses on a multitude of characters and heroes.

The miniseries will be looking into the past of just one of the marvel characters, Nick Fury.

But there are many issues.

The opening scene was really a fantastic beginning and explanation towards the invasion and sets the groundwork for the episode. But for about an hour it meanders, and doesn't really pick up the pace. They don't really deal with the scope of the situation and I just got board for most of it. I see the character work they're trying to do with Nick Furry and showing him in a position where he's vulnerable. But all they do to show that is that they make him look worn out meanwhile other characters are telling him that he's not ready.

Now, what made me really mad about the show is how they killed off Maria Hill. I understand that they were trying to build suspense and make people feel worried for other characters. But out of nowhere, they took her life, a character that's been known for over a decade and killed her. Killing her in the most boring and dull way possible. Not making me feel engaged, but making me feel confused and tired of what marvel is putting out. I was excited to see Maria Hill in the show and thought they'd make her a better developed character. But who cares about that. The only reason I feel emotional after her death is because of all the other movies she made small appearances in, that made me like her character.

This review is based off the first 5 episodes.


First the criticism.

In a universe so full of extraordinary superheroes and alien technology, it makes absolutely no sense that ""good old Fury"" is running around on his own, with a normal run of the mill pistol, to try to ""save"" earth from being taken over by aliens.

It's just unbelievable dumb in its premise, and despite excellent production quality (as is the norm for the MCU) the show is on track to get a 3.

BUT (and here is the kicker)... then enters Olivia Colman.

Her character lifts the entire show by 3 points, all by herself.

That understated, witty, stiff upper lip character just makes it all worth while.

More or less every time she is on screen you chuckle, if not laugh out loud.

Imagine taking her from ""The Crown"", with a few (obvious) changes, and then making her a much funnier stone cold killer, with absolutely no boundaries.

I'd happily watch an entire show based off just her character.

It takes the show from a waste of time, in an already overcrowded universe, to being something you find yourself grudgingly continuing to watch, despite all the illogical poorly thought out BS going on around her, just to watch what she does next.

I dearly hope they expand her character and give it a bigger part as the show develops, and I hope they are not dumb enough to kill her off, as that would instantly make me lose interest in this otherwise senseless drivel.",125,41
Secret Invasion,tt13157618,whiskey_charlie,"Jun 20, 2023",7,Good 1st Episode,"I liked the premise of the first episode, and while some might complain about the political insinuation, and so on... it's just a tv show, based on comic book fiction. Don't know if this series is going to be great, as there are 5 more episodes the writers/production team can mess up, but it's certainly headed in the right direction, and THANKFULLY, cringe worthy jokes have taken a backseat.

The plot's has already highlighted (or has it?!), a good line up of cast....am particularly liking this look on Fury. Has a Captain Ahab feel to it. Ben Mendelssohn is a joy to watch, as is Olivia Coleman, although it's uncertain where her character leads to. As is Don Cheadle's Rhodes. Sorry to see some familiar faces go.

Episode 1 ended on a cliffhanger, so definitely looking forward to the next episode. If the series maintains the current tone, it has the making of one of Marvel's better offering. One can only hope Disney doesn't go off the rails, as it has been known to do... 8/10 for now. This could change either way.",63,103
Secret Invasion,tt13157618,solminafya,"Jun 23, 2023",3,Interesting cast let down by poor writing and cheap direction,"From the very beginning, the debut starts with an overconsumed cliché of ""what if you can't trust anyone,"" which really isn't a core element in the narrative. However, the director relies on artificial mood-making using music and overloaded yet hollow and generic dialogues that carry no substance underneath at all.

What shall I say about what my eyes perceived? They perceived very bad CGI, uninteresting cinematography, and worst of all, cringy acting. Yes, acting is subpar at best. Extras and minor characters are a shame.

The narration is the worst aspect. Information unfolds in a very amateurish way that makes the show sound like it's written as a school skit.

To my own surprise, the best performance is not delivered by Sam Jackson nor Emilia Clarke, and not even by the well-endowed Olivia Colman. Rather, it's delivered by Ben Mendlesohn. Why? Because unlike each of them, he's already a linear actor with not much versatility, so he does what he always does: cold and emotionless expressions with a deep monotonous voice, which actually works for him!

Overall, it's a very mediocre show that doesn't match what's expected from its cast

Secret Invasion,tt13157618,ryanhwishart,"Jul 25, 2023",3,A bafflingly mediocre train wreck,"As a huge Marvel fan, I can't believe how badly written and executed this show really is. They started with truly talented actors, solid source material, and Disney level production value...and then I guess the House of Mouse ran out of money so they had to leave the writing to unpaid interns who clearly had second jobs to get to.

SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL EPISODE, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED:

The whole show revolves around shape shifting aliens who have slowly infiltrated the highest levels of the world's governments, but didn't bother to take the positions of the actual leaders who can order the nuclear strikes they so desperately want. Meanwhile, facing the literal possibility of humanity's annihilation, Nick Fury refuses to summon a single Avenger to help him stop this plot and instead chooses to run around armed with nothing more than a pistol and a can-do attitude. Two truly great characters from the MCU get killed off in incredibly boring ways to illustrate just how bad the antagonist really is (RIP Talos and Maria Hill, both taken far too soon and with no fanfare whatsoever). And if all that wasn't groan-inducing enough, the leader of the Skrulls manages to get his hands on some sort of technology that can replicate the powers of any of the Avengers or their enemies as long as samples of their DNA have been collected (because that not only exists, but shouldn't be explained at all and wouldn't have come in handy literally hundreds of times throughout Phases 1-4). But wait, there's more, because using said machine also allows the receiver of the superpowers to instantly wield every one of them at once without ever practicing. The situation is saved after Sam Jackson and Olivia Coleman (who is fantastic by the way, and honestly one of the only bright spots in this show) manage to take out all of POTUS's protective detail with knockout darts and expose the Skrull who's impersonating Col. Rhodes (even though the president knows Skrulls exist but never considered that the one main guy on his staff telling him he needs to start nuclear Armageddon might be one of them). The series ends with G'iah walking around with more powers than anyone else in the MCU, the president alerting the public to the threat of shape-shifters and essentially inciting public unrest and countless random assassinations across the globe, and Nick Fury and his Skrull wife walking off into the metaphorical sunset looking surprisingly pleased with themselves for a ""job well done"". Oh, and it's heavily implied that Fury and his wife have never even kissed in her original Skrull form, because no guy who has a shape-shifting wife would ever want her to switch it up every now and then (big eye-roll).

Disney should be ashamed of themselves for fumbling what could've been a really entertaining series.",128,21

I barely got through the first episode of flat, boring, dialogue and artificial tension as various left overs from MCU plot lines that went nowhere are given artificial life here. Jackson is well past his sell by and although the series tries to play up to that fact as a plot positive it only succeeds in emphasising how irrelevant Jackson has become. Mendehlson is an actor of serious talent but that is totally wasted here and Smulders just looks desperate as she reprises a role (yet again!) that she should have left alone several iterations ago. What is striking is how lucky Emilia Clarke was with GOT because she clearly cannot act. Please don't give this trash validation by watching out of some loyalty to franchise that has since spat on your forbearance, find something decent to watch.",86,61
Secret Invasion,tt13157618,BroadSword66,"Jun 21, 2023",3,You're no fun any more,"The Secret Invasion is so secret that everybody know all about it within minutes of Ep1 beginning. Where's the fun in that?

Fun?! You're in the wrong place for fun, chum. This is serious stuff: grim and gritty, dark and violent, loud and apocalyptic.

While the titular invasion is all too quickly out of the bag, there's a lot of other secret stuff to try to understand. Pay attention, though, because characters aren't so much introduced as thrust at the screen in a torrent of names. Who are they? Who knows! They could be members of the world's intelligence agencies ... or they could be shapeshifting invaders in disguise.

In the Marvel Universe where there are infinite realities, time travel and more superpowered heroes than you can shake a cape at, now we also have to contend with anybody potentially being a baddie pretending to be a goodie. Or they could be a double agent. Or a rogue agent. Confusing and twisted? Gordian Knots ain't in it!

The result is that the viewer can't trust anyone, anything, or anywhere to be what it appears to be. There is no firm place on which to stand to see the story unfold, and consequently it is hard work. Should we take notes, or fill in a spreadsheet? All this would be fair enough if it was also entertaining, but the characters are unappealing, the settings drab, the performances unengaging and sketchy.

Much money has been thrown at a cast peppered with Hollywood A-listers (Martin Freeman a beanie, Olivia Coleman doing her trainee Judi Dench act, and main man Samuel L Jackson from inside a hobo beard as Avengers godfather Nick Fury, back from outer space with a sad look upon his face) but those big names are distracting rather than distinguished.

Secret Invasion is frantic, rushed and rather noisy. Worse, it manages to make the end of the human race feel boring and unengaging. It's all sound and Fury, signifying confusion.",88,59
Echo,tt13966962,danwilberforce,"Jan 9, 2024",4,Why?,"The trailers made this seem like the first step into more gritty, adult content ala Netflix's Daredevil and Punisher series, but apart from 1 or 2 overally choreographed scenes it felt more like the worst episode of Iron Fist stretched into 5 episodes.

The concept itself isn't bad, but the writing was atrocious, with no real sense of character development or depth whatsoever. The only real standout being Vincent D'Onofrio's excellent portrayal of Kingpin, but even that is tarnished by the writing and a limp wiltering flower of an ending.

Echo also suffered from bad editing with the pacing and storyline feeling like they were all over the place.

The show had so much promise and I did appreciate the efforts made to honour the native American and deaf communities, but it didn't have to be at the expense of a coherent and gripping story.

Echo,tt13966962,Kamandi73,"Jan 9, 2024",1,Echo has no personality,"Echo has no personality, no charisma, no charm, just an angry scowl on her face or a blank stare, all the time. The only interesting parts were the appearances by Daredevil and the Kingpin.

The idea that The Kingpin has a whole bunch of thugs that speak sign language to Echo is ridiculous. Even more that Echo can kick in doors with the prosthetic foot on her leg. Echo is not a cyborg. The artificial limb attached to the stump halfway down her leg is attached with straps. The prosthetic is for walking, not kicking in doors.

There are thousands of U. S. military war veterans who (unfortunately) have prosthetic limbs. The prosthetics aid them in performing daily activities, like walking to the supermarket. Prosthetic limbs are held by straps and they cannot kick in doors.

All that aside, Echo is just a blank space. Her father got killed, and there was no emotion. Her sister wanted to see her, and she never responded. She confronts the Kingpin when she decides to get revenge, and there are no visible facial reactions. People talk to her and sign to her, and she just stares back at everyone.

Echo,tt13966962,residentgrigo,"Jan 9, 2024",5,Bland Filler,"What we have here is Secret Invasion 2.0 as many feared but the end product is less incompetent. Echo herself continues to be rather bland, her shamanic (?) powers feel shoehorned in so that marketing can pretend that they care about Native American culture and all other characters can barely be called as such. Material was cut but not enough if you ask me. The cringy cousin, the bad CGI train, etc. The show´s editing sucks in general.

Iron Fist S1 is better than this 3-hour ""film"", Arrow has better fight scenes and more on top of that. Daredevil´s one scene is a random half-fight in a flashback that just stops. A delete bit from Hawkeye or a studio mandate to create a trailer shot, unlike his fun use in She-Hulk. The TV-Ma is lastly an unearned marketing gimmick. Watch Reservation Dogs or rewatch Daredevil and Arrow S2. This ain´t it and will be the last time I finish an MCU show for the sake of it. No matter how short! Marvel Spotlight (what does this even mean?) is thus a bust.

PS: The post-Netflix Kingpin continues to suck but D'Onofrio tries his best and has more good scenes here than in Hawkeye. A deleted scene was sadly the only good one there. Why am I praising She-Hulk and Hawkey...?",180,125

Echo in a word is... well boring! It's not terrible as the show starts interesting enough, but like Secret Invasion, it falls apart in the end.

The show had some good cinematography and I guess good cgi when compared to recent Marvel projects. Maya is well written and is played fantastically by Alaqua Cox. Seeing Daredevil was great in his like two minute cameo, and Kingpin is great too.

But where this show falls apart is in its storytelling and writing. Nothing really happens in this show, and it leads to nothing. With an ending that just left me thinking, ""ok.""

My expectations were never high to begin with, but d*mn this could have been far better. I honestly didn't even know this show was released this week until I saw an advertisement for it on my TV.

One last thing who the hell told Disney this was TV-MA material there were like maybe two or three things max that made me think TV-MA and even then that was just pushing TV-14. If this is what Disney thinks passes for MA, then d*mn I'm scared for Deadpools 3 R rating.

Too much talking, too much useless drama and really not enough action.

Because after all we tuned in to see action, from a women that studied martial arts and can actually use it.

The first episode is very good and we get straight into the story of Maya, the mythical origins, her Indian back round, spiritual, how she lost her leg, and also become train in martial arts like she was.

Sadly after the first episode the show goes downhill fast, with more talking and drama than action, i hate to say this but you will get bored fast.

With that being said. Wow. This series was very choppy. Advertised as a 5 Episode mini series, Echo easily could've been a 2 hr movie. The fighting sequences were okay.

The story starts out showing that the Chicotaw Indians are supernatural beings from outer space or something? I wonder what the real world natives think of this crazy origin story? Anyways, having a tv show where the main protagonist cannot speak has major drawbacks unfortunately. There is a lot and I mean a LOT of silence in this show.. Communication takes place via sign language for the entire show. This is time consuming while the writers of the show have to think up other ways of explaining the story other than verbally to the audience. I don't think it works unfortunately.

I noticed that Hollywood is moving away from showing stars with the typical model figure and frame, and our protagonist has definitely expanded (I am ok with this) since the last time we saw her in Harkeye. This is immediately noticeable, and I am ok with it but I fear some others wont be.

The story itself is somewhat weak and has some weak writing, Whether a result of the strike, poor writers or the fact that the origin story for the first few acts is explained with zero verbal dialogue leaving the viewer to interpret what the heck is going on, To be honest I am not sure I absorbed the entire origin story understood correctly.

I tried to get into the show. There was a very weak Daredevil cameo for a few minutes that was not very good...again no talking from our protagonist but lots of sign language.

From episode two, it then descends at an alarming pace to be one of the worst series I've watched from Disney. Ending up right down there with Secret Invasion. Risible.

It's a short series but somehow manages to be boring for stretches and is extremely poorly paced. The lack of a tangible character arc is both frustrating and concerning. Maya starts the show as an immoral killer with the blood of dozens of people on her hands, yet goes through no real redemption or character arc; her past crimes feel like they're handwaved away as being all the Kingpin's fault. No accountability.

Stunts and fights vary between servicable and poor. They've ditched the character's ability in the comics to 'echo' and retain the fighting style of her opponents. This might have added an interesting dynamic to the fight sequences and made them stand out more. As it is, those abilities were described as 'lame' by the showrunners and have been replaced with the ability to see and interact with ancestors we don't know or care about and create strange symbols with her hands that have contrived and ill-defined abilities.

If I'd just seen the first ep then I would likely recommend giving the show a watch. As it is, this is more poorly written and at times cringeworthy Disney dreck.",144,83

Character development is minimal to none. Kingpin supposedly adopts Echo when she was very young and her parents died, but this is not really shown. Would have been a great place to start and to build up their relationship. Instead we are just told they are close and deal with it. It was jarring.

Native American spirituality and mysticism are often shown in flashbacks, not always for obvious reasons. There is some connection between the flashbacks and the nature of Echos healing power,but it is not clearly illustratred and not sold properly. Again, the scenes are jarring. By he way the comic book power she has is the ability to copy anyones fighting style. We never see this in the show.

The comic book character is deaf, and so is the actress. This was interesting and was great to see. Good to see actress play a major part. And she gives it all she has. However, the lack of hearing is used as a gimmick when fighting, as often sound is totally turned off. To show she is deaf. The problem though is that it makes the scenes boring. Sound is really important for immersion, They missed the boat somewhere here.

Echo, the star, as a character, is not likeable. Redeeming qualities are few and far between. She takes to killing like flies to dog poop. No remorse at all. Is selfish, does not care who pays for her actions. Wants to replace KingPin.

Hawkeye is shown briefly fighting her, probably to help market the show. So is Daredevil. They both fight her to a standstill, with Hawkeye coming closer to killing her. The encounters do nothing to develop her character though. They are used as simple plot devices to get to the next act. Feels empty.

She is supposed to be an anti hero? Vigilante? No. Just another criminal who is talented at killing and stealing. Her ambitions overcome any feelings of love for her sister and friends.

Echo is rated TV-MA. For someone like me who hates any kind of limitations/restrictions on movies/shows, that rating alone had me excited. And speaking strictly about the violence... yes, awesome, more. Some of the scenes are brutal. Showing headshots makes it feel more real and less like a fantasy world where everything will be okay.

As for the show itself, I adore the first episode. It does a great job of setting up the story with nonlinear storytelling, jumping back and forth from before and after the events of Hawkeye. And it has one of the best fight scenes in the entire MCU. I was ecstatic.

Now with even higher expectations, the remaining four episodes left me disappointed. Rather than this being an elite new entry in the MCU, it feels more like a bottom tier entry. And there are surprisingly few fight scenes, none coming close to the one from the first episode.

I watched it a second time and liked it even less. I had trouble getting through it and won't watch it again. Except that one fight scene from the first episode. Updating rating from 7 to 5 stars.

Echo,tt13966962,exzywu,"Jan 10, 2024",1,For those who thinks the fight sequence was good...,"Have you all lost your minds or forgot about how good the Daredevil show's fight sequence was? Or maybe you never watched Daredevil show before? This show's fight sequence is not even 10% as good as Daredevil show, the punches are not connecting and it doesn't make people feel strong either. The fight sequence of Daredevil show have both long shot camera and good quality, and the Echo show? It only have long shot camera but no quality, that's the difference between these two show's fight sequence.

As for the writings, I will say the first four episodes doesn't have a very excellent writing but it was not too bad either, but the writing of the finale is a total disaster, it's like the writers asked their kids or AI to write the script, which make the audience angry and confused.

Overall I think this show is a waste of good actors, I really feel bad for those actors especially Alaqua and Vincent.",82,68
Echo,tt13966962,jakewilson-32883,"Jan 9, 2024",2,Nothing special,"Just finished watching the show and I was disappointed. The trailers made it seem way more epic then it turned out to be.

What I liked: The acting was good. I can't really blame Marvel for their casting choices because they are usually spot-on and this was the case with Echo as well. Alaqua Cox was great at portraying Maya and the supporting cast more than held their own

What I didn't like: 1. The TV MA rating: Why was it rated TV MA? Serious question. The violence was tame at best. Not close to any of the Netflix shows, which this has constantly been compared to, bringing me to the next point.

2. The trailer: Felt like bait and switch here. Daredevil was in one episode for like a three minute fight scene and that was it. They were relying on Kingpin and Daredevil to draw in viewers, like me, which they did. My potential enjoyment of the show was impacted due to this. I would have preferred the trailer show what this show was really about instead of baiting fans of the old Netflix shows to watch.

3. Story: The story was quite weak which explains why its only five episodes. Maya's journey could have been wrapped up in an hour and a half max, which shows just how much filler there was.

4. Villains. Second show where Kingpin has come across as a tool. The reason Daredevil was so successful was because Kingpin was a formidable opponent for the protagonists. He was a serious threat and the show treated him as such. He was manipulative, and cunning to the point that Matt contemplates killing him once and for all. In this show he shows up, has dinner with Maya, promises to hand over the reigns to Maya then kidnaps her grandma and friend when she refuses. The way he was defeated was even worse than in Hawkeye and I was left speechless.

Marvel movies always left me wanting more, but since Endgame I have to force myself to watch the next movie/tv show. They didn't setup any future show/movie so it leaves you wondering what the point of this show was. Not the worst thing I have seen but it was dull and I will leave it at that.",78,60

There were some good scenes but not many. The story was alleged over the place. The actors had really rubbish dialogue. But, for me it was the missed opportunities.

The audience could have been given more immersion in how the world seems to this deaf hero. She cannot hear assailants so how does she cope with the traditional kung-fu multi attacker fight. We only have got a couple of ""quiet "" scenes demonstrating her deafness.

Maya is deaf and relies on sign language. Sign language users have tons of shortcuts and body mimes when communicating. It is not like subtitles with hand movements. More like moving emojis.

As regards her crime fighting artificial leg. More could be made of this. Para athletes will tell about the difficulty of fitting and wearing specialist limbs. We have a hero who wears one. Yet we never see the limb care and difficulty riding a motorcycle which has foot controls.

Marvel needs to listen to the people and bring back R-rated series with intense and bloody action sequences like Frank Castle on a rampage or Daredevil. That's real entertainment.

The script for this new series is far below the line of mediocrity. The animation has really bad text. I was negatively impressed. Instead of maintaining or maturing, they regressed in quality.

And there is no nostalgia talking here. I knew it wouldn't have the same quality, especially because the current scriptwriters are very bad. I just didn't expect it to be this bad. And there was a big shock due to the low technical quality of the animation itself. If you look at what was done in 1992 and what was done in 2024 in terms of features, coloring... Jesus!

The new (Kevin Smith) MoTU animation managed it (to an extent), so there was a chance.

I didn't make it very far. The dialogue is clunky and childish and aside from the widescreen, it shows no benefit to the animation of being produced recently.

It may be a feature of the original... but the sheer number of times that the characters refer to each other by name/code-name felt like forced fan-service and was tough to listen to.

With all the bad stuff Marvel has put out in recent years I couldn't imagine this show being anything more than mediocre. I expected a preachy show, that focused more on ideology and the current Zeitgeist. Boy, was I wrong.

X-Men '97 has superior writing. The dialogue is excellent, sometimes almost shakespearean. It comes with a fist full of nostalgia, easter eggs and fan service. The animation is pretty good, better than expected. Aaand...it has the theme song!

This show is everything I wanted and so much more. I love it.",162,32
X-Men '97,tt16026746,dark_bridger,"Mar 31, 2024",1,"Not very good, odd cult following puts this at 10/10 and ignores issues","I'm not sure why this has such a large cult following rating this a 10/10.

This series is far from flawless. When discussing the series with 10/10 users, they usually default to ""well it's a cartoon"". While that's true, a 10/10 cartoon isn't ripe with continuity errors.

I watched the entire first episode and part of the 3rd.

Let's break this down into a few categories. This is supposed to be a direct continuation of the previous series:

Continuity:

The first episode starts a year after the conclusion of the previous series. Multiple continuity issues exist and the changes aren't even referenced for having an explanation later on.

Xavier is presumed dead. At the end of the previous series he wasn't dead, he (well Morph actually) even broadcast to the entire world he was alive and well. How the entire world would now think he's assassinated is confusing. No reference to even hint at an explanation of how that changed.


Bishop is now present on the team, we are given no hint of an explanation how he arrived.


Storm has a mohawk, in the comics there was a storyline that went along with it. This one could be fixed, but no mention at continuity change.


Morph now primarily has a different appearance. This is very easily explainable, but no explanation is given.


While all of these things wouldn't need immediate addressing, they should have at least had a line of ""since Bishop joined the team"" or ""since Storm changed her hair"" or ""since Morph changed his form"". At least they should have acknowledged the changes and it would be ok for them to come back later on and give more detailed explanations.

Story Telling:

The first episode is a rehash telling of the first season. Sunspot appears as a new comer who runs away only to be found again, just like Jubilee was in the original series.


A discontinuous 2nd Mastermold suddenly appears and is destroyed in the first episode. There's a continuity issue as the original series had Gyric and Trask hiding from the first Mastermold, but didn't use the 2nd mastermold to stop it. If they feared the 1st one so much, they should have shut the 2nd one down. Trask even turned against the 1st Mastermold, so it's unknown why he would allow a 2nd one to exist.


The show seems to have to even retcon itself. Madelyne Pryor appears suddenly and with no explanation. What would have normally been some type of storyline thread of a season is condensed into 1 episode of unreasonably fast storytelling.


The dialogue here just seems really off, like they are trying to use 90s slang and snarkiness, and it's just weird. Storm mentions she commands the sands, but she doesn't command the sand, he commands the weather.


Ridiculous use of new and inconsistent powers:

Wolverine does not have super strength, but must possess it or Gambit would not have been able to jump on top of his back and ride him like a lawn mower. Wolverine in the old series could be injured. Certainly the impact on his body by having his adamantium claws explode with kinetic energy would cause him pain, but he's completely unaffected.


Cyclops falls from a blackbird, 3 flying X-Men decide to not assist him, so he unleashes a massive optic blast which does no damage to the ground. In many other scenes like this one of the X-Men would have assisted him or Storm would have used her winds.


Cyclops power can now push him backwards and have no impact on his neck. Maybe he has an adamantium spinal column now?


Storm and Bishop get taken out in the first episode by nobody goons and later Storm is identified has having Omega level powers. Either case is fine, but to have both scenes in the same episode is odd.


Animation Quality:

In some ways the animation has improved, in other ways its declined.

Rogue's hair has countably less lines. Her appearance is the most noticeable, she looks like a very different person.


Magneto's long hair is odd, he looks like an old grandma. They used a costume that was from the story they were telling, but that costume was odd even back then. If they aren't 100% following the comics (and they aren't) it would be okay to design a better costume.


The shading on Storm's costume is less well done. She now looks like she has black strips on her costume instead of shading.


On a plus side, Jubilee's face was drawn such that you can now tell she's of Asian descent.


The designs are generally less detailed, on some characters it isn't very noticeable, on others like Rogue it's pretty drastically different.


Other just weird stuff:

You'll notice some really odd scenes. In one scene, they are interviewing Gyrick and the camera keeps zooming in. You can't see his full face it's so far zoomed in. I thought it was going to keep going and just go inside of his nose or something weird.


There's another several scenes where they over zoom in on a person's face for a long period of time. I don't know what that's supposed to convey, it's just weird. Normally shows will do a head and shoulders shot, not ultra zoom in on someone's face unless they are trying to point out a facial expression or something.


Overall this seems like an incoherent mess that doesn't well follow the original series well and it even has to retcon itself to make its own story make sense. They should have just started a new series and not try to continue it from the old one. This continuation series is definitely not a 10/10.",48,134

I guess i'm in the minority who think this show is not on the same level as the original. Granted, I only watched the first episode but so far it seems to me that the focus of the show is more about nostalgia than story. It's more than just a nod, here and there, to the 90's show. It seems like the writers are just trying to pander to the audience who liked the old series. It's not terrible so far, but I think this series is not as good as the original. Some of the character personalities seem to have changed a bit.

But this reboot, if you can even call a reboot has none of the above. The storytelling was horrendous. It's very fragmented, just bits and pieces here, and bits and pieces there. Everything just happened without rhyme and rhythm, episodes after episodes. They feel more like filler episodes than anything else.

What's equally as bad is there's no character development like at all. It's presumed that the audience already knew these characters. Problem is, looks aside, they hardly even feel like there're the same characters. They're like complete strangers living under one roof, with no friendship, kinship, structure, nor curriculum to tie or link them together.

The dialogue is presented as if written by AI. The phrase "" My X-Men"" appears much too often. Which means more than once.

The voice acting. It goes without saying some voice actors make the roles theirs. That is not a possibility here. We remember the X Men voices as well as our own. This voice crew does not have the childlike flair to make this enjoyable. The voices are presented as if they're always in a tunnel, that's filled with sulfur hexaflouride. And Rouge... if the voice was stereotypical in the 90s , this is downright insulting.

I also gladly notice they didn't make a Wolverine show, and every mutant character is getting equal screen time and development, especially Cyclops getting what he deserves and shining as team leader. It's also welcome to see characters like Bishop and Morph join the X team. I liked Magneto's acceptance of Xaviers's human and mutant coexistence agenda and his decision to become a new leader of the X team because that made him a more three-dimensional and ambigious character rather than a one-note villain. This sequel is also very loyal and respectful to the old series and the nostalgic feelings of X-men fans. They are using the same character models, voiceovers, opening intro, closing outro, and music with improved and modernized animation. They didn't use the same opening stock footage intro from the first episode for the second episode's opening intro, adding new characters like Magneto and scenes to it, so obviously there is no laziness in this show.

Stellar cast, with Kathryn Hahn, Aubrey Plaza and Joe Locke being the standouts. Each character stands strong on their own, but the magic truly happens when they're together. The writers have a particularly clear PoV when it comes to the dynamic between Agatha and Teen, with Hahn's Agatha constantly giving him hell-pure comedic gold.

Agatha All Along,tt15571732,rannynm,"Sep 17, 2024",10,"This show exceeded my expectations. It is filled with suspense, mystery, dark comedy, and fantasy.","Marvel's Agatha All Along has me bewitched! This series continues Agatha's story after the events of WandaVision and is filled with suspense, mystery, dark comedy, and fantasy.

The story begins three years after Wanda has taken Agatha's (Kathryn Hahn) powers. She has no powers and no recollection of who she is. Under a spell, she believes she is a detective in a small town solving a murder. With the help of a teen (Joe Locke), the spell is broken. She must form a coven and travel the witch's road to regain her powers.

This show exceeded my expectations. It magically casts a coven of witches with great chemistry - Sasheer Zamata (Jennifer Kale), Rio Vidal (Aubrey Plaza), Alice Wu-Gulliver (Ali Ahn), Lilia Calderu (Patti LuPone), Mrs Hart (Debra Jo Rupp). The coven is hesitant to trust Agatha; her reputation precedes her. The witch's road challenges the fears of each witch on their journey to release a curse and help Agatha regain her powers. The witch's road offers five houses with a trial at each. Each house is themed and focuses on a weakness or fear of a specific witch. The trials bring chaos, suspense and self-doubt. Through this adversity, each witch faces their own fears, and the coven forms a bond strengthening their resolve as they continue their journey. Everything about this series is fabulous. The scenes are elaborate and transition into dark, fantasy-creating, spell-binding effects. From living rooms and basements, from the witch's road of glowing forests, all of the set designs and lighting bring this Marvel series to life. The costumes are elaborate and reflect the theme of each house. Special effects, combined with music, make each scene suspenseful. Agatha's character is self-centered, yet conflicted. We see her as evil and yet cannot help but love her.

The show's message is about teamwork and how trust and respect are proven through one's consistent actions. Viewers should be aware this contains witch horror, suspenseful scenes, partial nudity, foul language and other adult content.

That not everything has to be amazing. That it's okay to have a few misses here and there. That they still regularly put out high quality content. That even the bad ones aren't horrible.

And then there's Agatha All Along. A show I was immediately interested in because of my high view of Kathryn Hahn as an actress and my like for the character from Wandavision. But wow. Not only is it bad, I have literally zero interest in continuing. All I kept thinking is, ""Who in their right mind thought people would want to watch this? Who thought this was good enough?""

I need to reiterate, this is coming from someone who automatically watches everything the MCU puts out. If you've lost me, you have a problem.

Even worse, every problem introduced and every solution to those problems is simply ""magic."" It's zero clever and feels made up on the spot. Makes it impossible to get even a tiny bit invested.

Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Judging from the two episodes released so far, the quality is no less than that of Spectacular Spider-Man in 2008 and the Spider-Man animated series in 1994.

This is a Spider-Man story in a parallel universe, not a traditional Spider-Man story.

From the perspective of the play, the thought and ingenuity put into the first episode made the first episode so outstanding. It almost covers all the elements of Spider-Man adaptations.

Telling the story of Spider-Man from the perspective of a friendly neighbor gave me a big surprise. I like that Spider-Man gave the thief a second chance after catching her. I like Peter's daily life as a high school student. I like the interaction between Aunt May and Peter. I like that Lonnie is still strong in such a chaotic neighborhood.

The title cover of each episode is different. The arrangement of the music in the performance makes me very happy when watching Spider-Man swinging in city.

The second episode is about how Peter, a newcomer, balances heroism and daily life. The firefighting plot is really a classic in the Spider-Man story, and the screenwriter can still play new ideas in the classic.

The fight in the pet store is really interesting. Rescuing dogs, pet fish and birds really makes this character a lot cuter.

It's a strange show to understand why its been included as mot just part of the MCU's Phase 5 but its premiere - possibly to act as a soft introduction for later Phase 5 characters (Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio from Daredevil Born Again are included in the voice cast for the series)? - as it feels like a hard turn back into the bland and the slightly dull of the more unsuccessful entries of the previous Phase as opposed to something bold and new to let Kevin Feige et al show us that the MCU is back on course after a series of critically mauled misfires and burgeoning audience apathy.

Taken on its own merits, this is...fine. Its another Spider-Man origin story, albeit under a slightly different guise...but that's its main problem. It gets the benefit of the doubt after a fairly entertaining but utterly uninspired hour of television, with hopefully little of the meat of the narrative arc of the season revealed in any way yet...but so far, this feels like only a slightly different Spider-Man. And if this Spider-Man is only going to be slightly different, its as I said right at the beginning of this review...why?",91,114

Only the first two episodes have aired so far, but it's off to a great start. The animation is unique and fluid, and the story-telling has been interesting. I feel like we've gotten to know not just Spidey but also his cast of supporting characters in just this short amount of time. The dialogue is sharp, and the pacing is crisp -- I put it on as background noise, but found myself watching intently to see what was happening. And I'm ready for more. I can see a lot of story-telling potential already set up. It's following a lot of the classic Spider-Man beats -- and yet charting a completely original direction.

The show's animation, and story (at least so far) pale in comparison to other new animated properties such as X-Men 97', and the beloved Spider-Verse movies. Speaking of X-Men 97' and the Spider-Verse films, those properties feel like they have something to say, or that they want to bring something new to the world of animation, superhero's, comics, etc. In comparison, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man feels bland and lacking of anything that makes it its own.

The animation is fantastic, mixing simple images with complex movements.

It's unique enough to help the show stand out while staying simple enough to take nothing away from the other well done aspects.

Coming into the show, I had extremely low expectations. I thought the animation looked bad. I didn't like some of the comments that the main actor had made. I was a little disappointed when I found out it was no longer a prequel to the MCU Spider-Man. But all of this changed the moment I finished the first two episodes.

The animation looks way better than the trailer made it look. The voice acting and writing is on point and I was engaged throughout both episodes. Having Nico be Peter's best friend actually works well, although I do want Harry and Peter to eventually end up being close friends.

Something that I didn't like was that they unnecessarily race and gender swapped a couple of characters, but honestly it's not that noticeable and as long as you don't get super upset about that kind of thing, it's fine. Even though the animation looks way better than the trailer showed, it still does look choppy and wonky at times but the story makes up for it.

If you're a Spider-Man fan, definitely give this a watch. I'd say it's worth it. I'm excited for the new batch of episodes.

The animation style, while trying to be nostalgic, comes off as cheap and uninspired, lacking the depth and creativity that made the early comics so iconic. The storytelling is disjointed, and the characters feel flat, with none of the emotional resonance that has made Spider-Man such a beloved figure. Instead of offering a fresh take, this series feels like a missed opportunity, failing to capture the essence of what makes Peter Parker's story so compelling.

This means Parker will do some stupid things the original Parker would never consider. Since we are in a diverse culture I understand the changes in the supporting characters.

This show deserves better rating!,"I was very skeptical about this show since it was announced. TBH, even its trailer and the lack of hype around it made me almost skip this show, but I am glad I gave it a chance!

I am a big Spider-Man fan, so I have watched or at least know about many different shows, movies, and comics about Spider-Man. Trust me when I say the show gets better after the first two episodes.

I like their decision not to make this show feature in the main MCU timeline, so we are getting many unexpected and less popular characters from the Spider-Man stories!

I just finished all ten episodes, and I absolutely enjoyed this show. The episodes surprisingly felt like a breath of fresh air. There was something exciting in each episode, and the fact that they released the entire season in sets of two or three episodes per week was a good decision. Other shows, especially superhero-related shows, should release episodes like this, IMO.

Though I am praising this show, there are a few things that some people may not like, or this show might not feel enjoyable to them, but this is a different take on the same character we all know and love. With MCU having the rights to almost all of their crucial characters, I am glad they are using them all without messing with the main timeline.

The animation style is not something I really liked, but I got used to it after some time. Though they have made some changes to a few characters' origins and appearances, I feel it is more like the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse decision, where they are basically just considering a different timeline than the most common one.

I am excited about the next season, and I just hope they do not make fans wait too long. I recommend you give this a shot, but if you do, please watch more than three episodes.",57,27

It might not be The Spectacular Spider-Man, but it is still Spider-Man, and they have the opportunity to honor the character.

Disney is capable of great things, and I hope they prove my point after the first two episodes. You should definitely give it a shot and see what you might be missing.

Also, bl4ck people exist, g4y people exist(referring to Niko & Lonnie Lincoln) also police racially profiling absolutely exists, so if you negatively rate this show or downvote this review based on just that you're either a bigot or an idiot.

This show is already miles better than Far From Home & shaping up to be better than Homecoming as well. This has so much stuff that any Spider-Man fan could want. The characters & intrigue have also been done very well. It's cool to just see Peter doing classic Spider-Man things with Peter Parker problems that those comics have always highlighted so well to make him relatable to people. The animation is a bit jarring but the action scenes & swinging scenes are amazing they're so dynamic with awesome camera movements, not to mention the comic panel editing & cool transitions. I get why they went with this style so they could have awesome fights & swing scenes within a reasonable budget, which the MCU Spider-Man movies do not have. HC & FFH are some of the most sauceless superhero movies ever & the action & overall visual style of this show is so much better. Also Peter is in New York doing Spider-Man stuff which is awesome & he does basically none of that in FFH.

It's pretty annoying how this show already has some low ratings & review bombing by idiots because these shallow dumbos are rating it without even watching it & just basing it off the jarring animation style. It's pretty hilarious because people are so quick to criticize the look of animation but none of these people are actually smart enough to criticize live action stuff for bad cinematography, like most of the MCU has. Most of the MCU is bad visually, & if you think this is well then it fits perfectly in line with the MCU visually. But again none of these people are actually smart enough to tell good cinematography from bad because they're not actual film fans they just love theme park rides which the MCU is. They're so confident to talk about animation because it's easy to tell differences but when it comes to live action stuff they're none the wiser because they don't have an eye for artistry, they couldn't tell The Batman visuals apart from Avengers 1(which looks like a made for TV movie).

If this show was in crappy cinematography live action form all these smooth brains would be going bananas over it because this show gives you most of what you would want from a Spider-Man property.

People need to actually watch this show & pay attention to the nuances instead of only focusing on the animation & just rating it based off short clips they see on the internet. It's a very good show & its review bombing on here is very disappointing because you can tell people are judging it without watching it because they're just not smart & a lot of them think animation is for kids which is a whole other level of stupid.

Also, now the camera quality seems lower quality, the lighting is way too bright for night scenes, and the set designs look like low budget stages instead of stunning on-location shots like they used to do.

So I started rewatching the Netflix version, and damn, it just felt so much more layered. The character introductions actually felt connected to the audience. I don't know, maybe it's just me. I've never read the comics, so I'm not sure if this newer tone is closer to the source material or not.

But for me, and honestly, for a lot of people, the Netflix version is the Daredevil we fell in love with. That depth, that grittiness, the emotional weight... it's kind of missing from the Disney one.

For my taste it was the best thing in the Marvel universe to ever come out. The grittiness , the sheer brutality, and heart of the characters made it shine brighter than anyone could've imagined.

When Disney acquired Marvel, the show was put on a hiatus along with all the other Netflix marvel series. No one knew if we'd see this brilliant version of daredevil and punisher again. Thankfully they made the right choice and brought them both back and I can honestly say once again, it has reignited the MCU in much needed fashion.

It starts off where it ended with such a fluidity and continuation of quality. It's actually uncanny how close they managed to come. All the actors are still top-notch and on top of their game. The characterization is just so impeccably written it's flabbergasting. With an even bigger budget, the action sequences, and overall dynamo has been upped to insane levels. The level of production quality on this is truly mind blowing.

As a huge fan of the original series I was super pumped hearing all the actors talk about how it was a return to form and how they reshot it and made it more grounded and gritty and blah blah.

It's not. Go watch 20 minutes and you'll see all you need to see. Too much CGI, terrible fight sequences, and incredibly unrealistic situations - AND they throw out his whole inner battle within the first 20 minutes - like the whole basis for what and who Daredevil is gets tossed off a roof in the first act!

See for yourself - like you owe it that much - but if you're like me and you were a real fan of what the first three seasons offered, you'll know - just like me - within the first 20 minutes that this is NOT the Daredevil we deserve.

On episode to episode basis this comes down to this: what does the protagonist want?

Watching this show - and we are almost at half point of the season - I don't have an idea. Matt Murdock doesn't really seem to want to everything, he just is and goes with the flow. The story has no premise, no goal towards which the audience knows it goes. In other words, there's no story arc.

Fisk has a hint of story arc but even he doesn't have an overarching goal. He wants to make New York better, but that's really vague and that's not a personal goal which every character needs. And if it is, then the writers should us why it is personal to him.

Without basic motivation, this is pretty boring to watch. Actors are doing pretty fine job, Cox especially. But without substance.",129,44
Daredevil: Born Again,tt18923754,IAMDB_,"Mar 5, 2025",6,Woefully Underwhelming,"The series begins with one of the clunkiest action sequences I've ever had the 'pleasure' of watching; set within a framework that after a 6 and a half year hiatus felt almost alien and most certainly disjointed.

The rest of the episode carries through consisting mostly of promotional scenes we've already seen, rounded out by the all too typical fanfare one should come to expect.

None of this would be some compromising issue on it's own, although when put into the context of the existing art direction, or rather, lack thereof, the entirety winds up coming off almost as more of a fan-piece, than some mult-xillion dollar production.

Perhaps I'll find myself pleasantly surprised by that which has yet to be released, or perhaps the decade since the release of the original has jaded me beyond compare. Either way, suffice to say, whatever spark the original had that lead to an entire mini-universe surrounding it, definitely didn't hit me upside the head.",124,47

Born Again has been tainted with what a lot of the more recent Marvel shows have: a disjointed plot, a lack of a vision, and flat writing. 5 mins in Foggy's dead, 10 mins later Karen is gone for good. 20 mins later, it's all sunshine and rainbows. 2nd episode in, Kingpin is somehow in marriage counseling.

The pacing is much faster than the original show which took some getting used to, but considering the shorter 9-episode format and the fact that the show is catching us up to the present timeline it's a welcome addition to the content.

The storytelling feels rushed-they killed Foggy in the first episode, which was a huge mistake-and the characters lack depth. Matt Murdock's internal struggles and moral complexity, which were central to the original, are barely explored. Disney took away what made Daredevil unique-its rawness, emotional weight, and street-level realism. The Netflix series was a masterpiece, with its dark tone, compelling villains like Kingpin and Punisher, and a sense of consequence.

Charlie Cox slips back into the role like he never left - conflicted, relentless, and just as compelling. The writing is tight, the pacing works, and the action still hits hard where it counts.

But... let's talk about the one thing that's been bugging me: the **""budget Spider-Man"" acrobatics**. Swinging across buildings with the billy club might look cool in a storyboard, but in practice? It feels completely unnecessary. Daredevil isn't supposed to fly through the skyline - he's the guy scaling walls, dropping into back alleys, and scrapping in hallways. The overdone swinging just breaks the immersion a bit and makes it feel like they're trying too hard to superhero-ify him.

If it weren't for that one stylistic misstep, I'd honestly give this a 10/10. Still, *Born Again* stays true to what makes Daredevil great: raw emotion, brutal fight scenes, and a hero who bleeds - physically and morally. Highly recommend.",100,43

I was happy to hear that they had changed the story to include Nelson, Murdock, and Page since there's no Daredevil without them. But it turns out they really haven't. It's the same story as before-they were meant to die, and while they might not show it explicitly, they likely hired the actors just to kill off their characters.

As for the plot, it seems like they'll take the first six episodes to bring Daredevil back and to set up Fisk's downfall. It'll probably end with a big battle between Daredevil and Fisk, with Spider-Man showing up since Spider-Man 4 is in the works. Way to kill off a solid character for barely any reason, Marvel. Gg!

Riri is amazing, apparently, because everyone says so, but why? Nobody knows, just keep saying she's amazing and it'll stick.

She didn't earn the suit, she's not strong, funny or cool. She's just feels like an NPC who stumbled upon Excalibur laying on the floor and claims she's the king of the world. She helps her fellow students cheat on their tests and projects, seeking her out just to use her to not fail. So she didn't earn anything and she's surrounded by people who didn't earn anything, in fact everyone is just ripping off everyone else, just like Ironheart is a ripoff of Ironman.

Imagine if you went to the valedictorian of your class and said ""make this work for me or I'll fail"". What kind of message does that send the audience? That it's okay to get by in life if you just let somebody else do your job for you?? That's insane! Tony Stark was the head of a massive successful business and one of the smartest minds on the planet and he didn't need everyone telling him he's amazing.

That's insulting to both the character and the fans who watched him grow over more than a decade of films.

And I get it-new characters need to rise. The torch must be passed. But you don't honor the past by pretending it was irrelevant. You build on it. You respect it.

The acting was solid overall. I recognized a few familiar faces, while others were new to me. I can tell the antagonist has the potential for more complexity, but perhaps the first two episodes didn't require it yet. I'm looking forward to seeing how that develops. The main lead, however, stood out with her ability to convey a wide range of emotions through subtle facial expressions. Truly impressive work.

I read the comic books a few years ago, and I think the writers did an excellent job of drawing from the source material while making the story their own. It feels both fresh and faithful. The narrative remains tight and concise, which is refreshing. Although the plot unfolds in a futuristic and highly advanced universe, the themes feel grounded and relatable, particularly the challenges faced by younger generations, the urgency of Gen Z's desire for change, and the resistance they meet from those in power. That dynamic alone gives weight to the show's premise, ergo the title of this review.

If there's one area where I'd hope for more, it's the action. I understand the importance of setting up the backstory properly, and I trust that it's building toward something bigger.

I think the actors in the show are great so far as well. I also love Joe so far I think they can do some fun stuff there too.

This whole criminal heist ring concept is really fun actually. Something to where her genius abilities actually make sense and are useful.

The only thing I'm not exactly sold on yet is The Hood I was wanting some Ghost Rider demonic dark mystical stuff and it's hinting at that but not enough for my liking. I think the character is way more interesting than the show is making him. And Riri's male love interest is kind of one note and not interesting at all but luckily he is barely a presence in the show. I think we could have done without that.

But I love the rest of the crew Slug and Clown are stand outs so far. I love Riri's mom. I love Joe. Love the whole aspect of community being brought into it with the little boy with the wagon and the owner of the garage.

And I think the trauma of her past is ok not incredibly compelling but also not terrible either. But so far I'm enjoying it more than some MCU things.

I think people decided to hate it without even watching it. And that's a bummer. I don't think it's the greatest thing ever but I also don't think it deserves a 4 out of 10 that is crazy. It is infinitely more entertaining and enjoyable than that. I'd say it's about a 7.5-7.8.",253,449

The story to me flows well and there wasn't a point in time where I was confused or had to question something happening.

It's only 6 episodes but each episode so far have been a good length of time where it felt too short.

Only watched the first 3 episodes so far. I'm hoping it finishes strong.

Dominique as Riri Williams is incredible. I'm obsessed with N. A. T. A. L. I. E.! She's just the right kind of comedic relief and sounding board for Riri. Anthony Ramos really surprised me right out the gate for a character I had little familiarity with. The whole crew is delightful. Shea Couleé as 'Slug' is just the role she needs to break into the real acting game. Absolutely adore her! Cree Summer lends her oh-so-recognizable presence to the show as Ms. Stanton, and her small part has already made me love her. I can't wait to see how the season progresses!",138,489
Ironheart,tt13623126,athornell-00377,"Jun 24, 2025",6,Ironheart gets on base but doesn't score a homerun!,"I have edited my original review, because as I am watching episode 4, I feel less excited and engaged.

I have enjoyed Dominique Thorne's intensity and scrappy persona as Ri Ri / IronHeart since Wakanda Forever! With that said; this 'Alice going down the rabbit hole' woe is me theme and storyline is dark and epidemic of other recent Marvel shows.

This fragile and weak super hero or anti-hero storyline- She-Hulk, Ms. Marvel, even Hawkeye (and the Thunderbolts)...it can only go so far Marvel!

Honestly I kept expecting Shuri from Wakanda to show up and save the day. Or I kept hoping...She would save the day and save the characters... What is and isn't working is the narrative explores psychosomatic and social angst of Iron Heart's key characters and how the impact of death as well as identity and power impact people's circumstances and choices.

Hence the Hood (played by Anthony Ramos). He is an intriguing villain that we don't know much about.

The storytelling unfolds at a slow pace, almost too slow in some parts. The action does too.

I want to like this show, but it is hard when I don't like the main character. Ri Ri is suffering from grief and trauma and her own ego and keeps making mistakes out of fear. Which makes it hard for her to be a hero. I guess that's the point Marvel is trying to make? But the fans who are watching this series are suffering in the process. It started out good but seems to have drowned in its' own sorrow.

Marvel get it together and bring back the blockbusters. Put a pause on the dark melodrama TV series. Daredevil is excellent! But everybody and every Marvel character isn't going to score a home-run! Ironheart gets on base but doesn't get off third.",213,399
Ironheart,tt13623126,info-90701,"Jun 25, 2025",4,Boring beyond!,"This show suffered from writers who don't understand what makes something dramatic and or interesting, so the writing just drones on and on and on with underwhelming scene after underwhelming scene. There are so many opportunities to make this extraordinary but these people would have to understand enough about creating drama to know how to do that, and they simply do not. This is at every turn, in every scene, and on and on. They seem to believe that savvy tech, and concepts alone will make it interesting, but it doesn't.

I hope they get better writers, soon too, because the basic premise perhaps could be interesting, if . . .",265,343
Ironheart,tt13623126,jbell9384,"Jun 24, 2025",10,Excellent!,"The character development in Ironheart is one of the series' strongest features. Riri starts off as a brilliant but somewhat guarded teen, unsure of how her abilities fit into the larger picture. As the series progresses, we see her grow in remarkable ways. Her grief over the loss of her father, her complicated feelings about Tony Stark's legacy, and her struggle to balance her own identity against the expectations placed on her - all these elements are explored with nuance. Her evolution feels earned, not rushed, and by the end, Riri isn't just wearing a suit - she's embodying the values that make a true hero.

Supporting characters are not left behind, either. The show does an excellent job fleshing out Riri's community, especially her mother, Ronnie, who adds emotional weight and grounding to the story. Their mother-daughter bond is touching and realistic - full of warmth, tension, and love. Her friends and classmates aren't simply there to fill space; they contribute to the story in meaningful ways that reflect themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and authenticity. Even antagonists like The Hood bring surprising depth and moral complexity, challenging viewers to think more critically about power and justice.

Another standout aspect is how Ironheart balances high-tech action with human emotion. Yes, the armor is sleek, the battles are thrilling, and the stakes are high - but it never forgets that the core of the show is Riri's humanity. The visual effects are impressive, but they never overshadow the story. Instead, the tech becomes an extension of Riri's character - a symbol of both her potential and her inner battles.

The writing deserves particular praise. It's sharp, layered, and emotionally intelligent. The dialogue feels natural, even as it weaves in larger themes of race, class, legacy, and belonging. The show doesn't shy away from social commentary, but it also never feels preachy. It presents challenges without offering easy answers, letting the characters - and viewers - wrestle with the complexity of real-world issues.",133,470

Somehow in the last chapter they manage (as always) to play with time travel breaking the rules already established in Avengers Endgame like if marvel didn't remember how the universe they created worked. Most of the characters are too flat and uninteresting to make you care about their fates, which leads to a complete disconnect from the series. I'm giving it one star because I wasn't expecting anything and ended up disappointed somehow.",25,49
Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,ranganijay,"Jul 31, 2025",6,Visually Stunning but Narratively Shallow,"This is my honest fan review and some constructive criticism, shared in the hope that it helps the creators improve future content.

The visuals, art style, action choreography, costumes, and animation are all impressive. However, the character design and dialogues could have been much better. The background sets for Wakanda also felt a bit lacking in depth and detail.

I feel that the MCU now has a much older and more mature audience than it did at the start. So it would have been better if the story and characters had more depth, with a tone that felt more grounded, realistic, and serious.

It would have helped if the series had explained what the artifacts actually were. They felt a bit dull, just glowing purple stones. I think it would have been more interesting if they had unique purposes or origins. Also, some of the ancient technology didn't feel believable. Having a wireless device in 1000 BCE is just too much. I understand that Wakanda is highly advanced due to vibranium, but that doesn't mean it should be able to create anything without limits.

It would have made more sense if Wakandan technology had evolved in a different way, with unique functions and working styles - not just the same modern tech like button-pressing, flying ships, laser beams, electric bombs, radios, encrypted messages, and trains. These technologies made sense in the Black Panther films because they exist in our world and Wakanda could have advanced versions of them. But in a historical setting, they felt out of place.

Also, Wakandan science and identity should not rely entirely on vibranium. Vibranium should be treated like a resource - like water or electricity - something powerful, but not the whole foundation of their culture or science.

Episode Two was, in my opinion, the best of all. However, the use of Iron Fist felt like a waste. I liked the female version, but her character lacked proper development. The story could have been stronger if not all episodes revolved around the artifacts.

Lastly, please use time travel more carefully. If it's used too often, it loses its impact and meaning.",47,21

Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,jaymanbenltley,"Jul 31, 2025",8,"Beautiful, Impactful, and Marvel at Its Most Human","Eyes of Wakanda stands out as a visually stunning and emotionally rich expansion of the MCU, and honestly, I'm baffled at the wave of unwarranted 1 stars it's already receiving. This show is breathtaking-not just in its animation but in its ambition. If you're hearing it's ""not worth your time,"" check that noise at the door and experience it yourself.

From the first episode, it hits like a moving painting: episode one is often described as ""premiere energy at its finest,"" which sets a gripping tone that carries you through all four stories . From ancient Ethiopia to mythic Crete, its painterly, hand-drawn visuals create a style that's rich and textured-no wonder critics have compared it to art brought to life, calling it ""moving painting"" worthy of a museum .

The show packs action, heart, and culture into tight 30-minute chapters. Characters like Noni and the Lion offer complicated, emotional storytelling, while episode three's ancient Iron Fist arc adds unexpected depth and connectivity to Marvel's broader history . Though some stories feel a bit rushed due to limited runtime, moments shine with real emotional stakes and world-building ambition.

If you've listened to the hype-either good or bad-give yourself a clean slate. Watch Eyes of Wakanda without the internet drama in your ears. You'll find a show that's loud in its beauty, grounded in its themes, and courageous in its storytelling.

Rating: 8/10. Gorgeous, bold, thoughtful, and absolutely deserving of praise. Don't let the noise drown out what this show truly is-it's a rare gem in Marvel's parade.",28,31
Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,AbrahamW-5,"Jul 31, 2025",9,"A Visually Stunning, Brilliantly Ambitious Marvel Masterpiece","Eyes of Wakanda is one of those rare Marvel ventures that stops you in your tracks not because of big explosions or flashy cameos, but because it's unapologetically beautiful and deeply thoughtful. From the opening sequence, it felt less like a cartoon and more like a living, breathing piece of art. The show leans into a hand painted animation style inspired by Ernie Barnes and Dean Cornwell, creating visuals that critics describe as ""a moving painting"" that truly honors Wakanda's soul.

Across its four episodes, each story shines: Episode One's mission to Crete is high stakes and emotionally resonant; Episode Three's ancient Iron Fist arc connects legacy and mythology in a way that feels earned, not forced. I found myself fully immersed in the moral dilemmas-loyalty vs duty, isolation vs expansion-that feel like Black Panther elevated to its most cerebral form.

Some critics pointed out pacing issues and storytelling shortcuts due to the short format and they're right. A few arcs, especially in the middle, feel undercooked and don't get the emotional payoff they deserve. But the finale ties it all together beautifully, exploring legacy and sacrifice and literally weaving in Black Panther lore in a smart, satisfying callback - a payoff that made my heart skip a beat.

It's frustrating knowing this four episode miniseries is getting unjust one star reviews from people who only hate downvote because of the lead characters, not because they watched. That noise doesn't reflect what this story is doing. Eyes of Wakanda shows that Marvel still knows how to deliver emotionally rich, intelligent storytelling through animation.

This isn't just filler content-it's a bold experiment that pays off and shows what Marvel can do when it leans into art, history, and cultural weight instead of chasing trends. I came away feeling both inspired and hungry for more.

Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,universalarghyaroy,"Aug 4, 2025",2,BORING,"As a long-time fan of the Marvel Universe, I went into Eyes of Wakanda hoping to experience something fresh, powerful, and unique-especially considering the rich legacy of Wakanda and Black Panther. Unfortunately, what I got was a dull, uninspired anthology that completely misses the mark.

The show consists of four episodes, each telling a different story, but the frustrating part is-they all follow the same exact plot structure. Different characters, different settings, yet somehow every episode feels like a recycled version of the last. There's no narrative progression, no emotional payoff, and no sense of originality. It's like watching the same uninspired script played out four times in a row, and by the third episode, I was already fighting off sleep.

What makes this even more disappointing is the expectation. When you hear ""Wakanda"" or ""Black Panther,"" you naturally anticipate something extraordinary-something filled with culture, depth, and innovation. Eyes of Wakanda delivers none of that. There's no improvisation, no risks, and no standout characters or moments. Even the animation, while decent, can't save the lackluster storytelling.

It feels like Ryan Coogler may have had a vision for this project, and the effort from the creative team is evident-but somewhere along the way, that vision got lost. Instead of celebrating Wakanda's mystique and legacy, the series reduces it to a repetitive fetch-quest formula that goes nowhere.

In a franchise known for boldness and world-building, this series is shockingly forgettable. I genuinely wanted to like it, but Eyes of Wakanda left me bored, frustrated, and ultimately disappointed. I don't usually say this about Marvel content, but this felt like a complete waste of time.

Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,SHU_Movies,"Jul 31, 2025",6,Moderately Entertaining,"Marvel Studios' Eyes Of Wakanda is a four-part anthology series, with each episode following a different Wakandan War Dog during different time periods. With the nice animation, good action, well thought-through stories and interesting characters, it's a moderately entertaining mini-series that expands nicely on the lore of the Wakanda in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It may not necessarily be a good series, but it's definitely enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are way better ways to pass a couple of hours, and the contents of this series could quite easily be summarised in a 60-second video on YouTube or TikTok. Because of this, I wouldn't recommend it to casual fans. I'd only suggest that you watch it if you're a hardcore fan of the MCU, or you're a fan of Marvel Comics (because Episode 3 made me very happy as someone that's been a life-long fan of a particular mystical character).",18,21
Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,simbiat,"Aug 5, 2025",3,Why?,"Like... Why? I seriously do not get the point of these shorts. They did not explore much (if anything) about Wakanda. They seemingly did not expand MCU either. They just forced people from Wakanda into various time periods and locations, where they may or may not make any sense. Especially with the interpretation of Trojan War in 2nd episode. Which is, indeed, the strongest episode of the 4. Probably because half of it is not original.

Visually it's ok. Not bad, not particularly good. At least, not that good to be the reason to even make this thing. It does not explore anything interesting like ""What If?"", and I do not think there are easter eggs for Marvel fans. Unless you want to count an Iron Fist in 3rd episode, but it could have been any other Chinese woman, really.

And the tech? Oh, it does not make sense. Long distance communication device during Trojan War? Seriously? Vibranium was a awesome, yes, but it did not automatically turn everyone around it into geniuses, who could transcend time and space in their minds. This was clearly written by people who do not understand how technology evolved through-out human history. Even Assassin's Creed makes more sense when they drop some futuristic tech in those games.

Only saving grace here, is that there are just 4 episodes, but is that a good enough justification to watch these? I'm not sure.",24,13

The story was engaging, but something was missing-perhaps a deeper emotional core or more time to let the characters breathe.

It's hard to think about who approves all these projects these days, and no one realizes that what the MCU needed was to get back to its roots so it could be reborn.

Is ""Eyes of Wakanda"" a bad series? No, it isn't.

Is it an unnecessary series? Absolutely.

It's with this premise that I sat down to watch the series, and it's really not bad. It has interesting points, expands the lore and history of Wakanda over hundreds of years, and even has a time-travel episode that ties in with the first film.

However, let's be honest, no one is going to watch this series, and just as there was no promotion for it, it will pass unnoticed on streaming. Only MCU fans and content creators will dedicate a few lines to it and then move on to more interesting projects.

All this makes me wonder if there's a future for this universe. After all, ""Avengers: Doomsday"" is just around the corner, and everything that preceded it and the current news suggests a huge disaster.

Positives for Eyes of Wakanda (2025): The animation for this show looks amazing. I like the idea of traveling throughout different timelines in Wakanda and seeing different characters doing things. There are some fun action sequences in these 4 episodes. The characters are interesting and you want to see more of them. And finally, this show is easy to binge through on Disney+.

Negatives for Eyes of Wakanda (2025): There are only 4 episodes in the mini series which is fine enough, but I wanted more from the story.

Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,thomasubieda,"Aug 1, 2025",6,Eyes of Wakanda,"A miniseries that expands the lore of Wakanda, adding interesting details and leaving room for certain debates. It has attractive concept art.

""Eyes of Wakanda"" is an entertaining, simple, and very acceptable proposal due to the addition of narrative aspects that in a way promote the entire environment of Wakanda, its beginnings, or stages at various points in time. It can be very entertaining depending on your expectations or very mediocre in what it aims to convey, however, it has merit in terms of all its elaboration and the work behind the final result.

It's one of those Marvel productions that tries a twist on animation, and it's fine; all that visual aspect is reflected on screen and it has pleasant moments. I can highlight the overall concept art, which has a level of detail, creativity, and ingenuity that dazzles at all times. The ability to encompass that original style and the designs in the stories deserves a great point. Each of the environments seen in the episodes is striking and full of energy.

There are 4 episodes that cover different stories, themes, objectives, and reflections that come together to somewhat complement the ideals of a resource-rich country in different eras, all with the aim of creating a coherent link with characters already seen in the 2018 movie ""Black Panther."" Being able to see certain small details, references, stories, and the introduction of new characters, I believe, fulfills in some way.

It should be noted that it is not an animated miniseries that will revolutionize the Marvel universe, but it can entertain true fans. In addition, from my perspective, it is not the best of all Marvel Animation productions either; works like ""X-Men 97"" or ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" are better, emphasizing plot, impactful moments, animation, and story. Even so, ""Eyes of Wakanda"" can be enjoyed.

The animation seems well-crafted to me, it has nuances, colors, designs, sequences, and attractive designs, its goal is well-deserved. Despite that, there's a small detail about the characters' gaze or facial features that doesn't quite convince me. The environments, locations, and so on are very well done. The musical score carries weight within the plot.

Now then, each episode has questionable details, whether due to conventions, the strength of the script, better execution of the development, more engaging plots, or exploiting the potential they had. It is evident that there are one or two episodes that leave much to be desired, whether due to the narrative argument or character development. In my experience, the second episode is the best due to the connection established in various parts through the protagonists' goals, covering real historical themes and certain creative details.

""Eyes of Wakanda"" serves as another window to provide stories that can be entertaining for many viewers, fulfilling in certain details, but dividing the critics considerably. Ryan Coogler's work and his love for the culture are evident.

The essence of the comics is present and appreciated. It's a product that could have been much better, but it works. The added characters have their importance, and especially those connections with the live-action movies. Iron Fist is back in the house.",16,11

The animation is absolutely stunning, hooking me from the very first frame. I'm genuinely impressed by how the creators managed to craft a compelling story across just four episodes, especially when it initially seemed like it might lack structure.

I don't think they were successful in their way to include Wakanda heroes into real historical events, or at least popular myth, like the Trojan horse. It feels out of place and they don't take advantage of them to make impactful arguments about our history.

The art was not that great either, not a big fan of how they made the faces, they all look like they have too much makeup on. There are some beautiful moments there, but the overreliance on ""yellow rays of light"" makes everything too dull when it could have had a brighter contrast.

I also thought the cast of characters were interesting and played well by their actors.

That said, I did enjoy the fight scenes and the tech; those were definite highlights.

Eyes of Wakanda,tt13968252,stefantodorovic-13218,"Aug 7, 2025",8,This is a very good show!,"Eyes of Wakanda is, without exaggeration, one of the most stunning projects Marvel has ever put out. From the first frame, it's clear this series is something special. The animation style is breathtaking - every shot feels like a hand-crafted painting brought to life, rich with detail and bursting with color, yet never losing that grounded, lived-in feeling of Wakanda's world.

The storytelling is tight, sharp, and emotional. Each episode dives into a different era and mission, following Wakanda's elite operatives as they risk everything to protect their nation and recover Vibranium artifacts across the globe. What's remarkable is how much depth they manage to pack into short episodes. The pacing never drags, and the tone balances action, history, and emotional weight perfectly.

What truly makes Eyes of Wakanda worthy of a 10/10 is how it expands the MCU without feeling like filler. Every mission matters, every character feels alive, and the stakes are both personal and global. You get to see sides of Wakanda we've never explored in the films - the shadows behind the throne, the untold sacrifices, and the moral dilemmas that come with guarding a secret as powerful as Vibranium.

The action choreography is fluid and inventive, using the animation medium to deliver sequences that would be impossible in live-action. But it's not just spectacle - the series has real heart. There are moments that hit you emotionally, from personal sacrifices to connections with the events of Black Panther. It's layered, thoughtful, and still manages to be a thrill ride.

Simply put, Eyes of Wakanda doesn't just meet expectations, it surpasses them. It's Marvel at its boldest - visually stunning, narratively rich, and emotionally resonant. For fans and newcomers alike, it's an easy, unquestionable 10/10. Wakanda Forever.",7,9

Marvel Zombies,tt16027014,petemclaughlin-24277,"Sep 23, 2025",7,Tired post-endgame formula,"Ive just come across this new animated adventure that has had zero advertising or promotion from what ive seen. Usually you get something, especially as it seems its in the same animation style as the 'What if?' saga. After around 5 minutes of viewing you can see why. Now i am a massive fan of the What if? Series, all 3 seasons. I know critically the last season wasnt recieved well but i enjoyed it all the same

Marvel Zombies starts with new batch of annoying young characters that have had marvel fans tuning out for years and its clear to see within the opening few scenes. Theyve (again) positioned Riri as this amazing genius amd the leader of this little pack and the writing is just atrocious. What we had with the old Avengers dynamics is that each character would shine in their own way but not at the expense of the others. What you always have here is a constant bombardment of how much of a genius Riri is without any reason as to why. What you do get in this little group dynamic is that each character is written dumber so that Riri can spell out the obvious thus elevating her to the smartest in the room. Unfortunately, if the audience doesnt have an IQ of 10 then its painfully obvious that its framed this way. Tony Stark was written with conflict within which ever group he was in, it made sense for this arrogance as his brilliance always over shined that and it also wasnt at the expense of the other characters. Here its just a race to the bottom and unfortunately, because of this, it does not have the same charm as the what if series and clearly ranks in a time when the writing was so bad that it destroyed and franchise.

No wonder this wasnt promoted, you can see why disney wanted this to disappear into the night just like Ironheart

Absolutely awful.",49,76
Marvel Zombies,tt16027014,Kristf-0,"Sep 23, 2025",6,I expected more,"There was a lot of potential in this series, but all the characters in it are not enough even by the MCU scale (except Blade, he was just good). I think it was a big mistake to make Ms. Marvel and other not-so-popular characters as main characters, and those who would have been interesting were given little time. Now it would have been possible to bring in an X-Men or other unseen character, even if it's not canon. I really don't understand why there wasn't anyone popular in it, because I understand that they didn't want to synchronize them and save money, but they still included, say, Black Panther, Captain America, who didn't have a single line, so why couldn't they have brought back Iron Man, or Black Widow, or anyone, at least as a zombies?

This series was made in the current MCU concept, regardless it's full of gore,but they try to say something funny in every 3 episodes,like this series made for younger people. The best example of this is Red Guardian, who I thought would be made a little more mature after The Thunderbolts. The biggest stupidity is related to him and his family, specifically at the end of every episode one of them dies by sacrificing themselves,after Yelena sacrificed herself, all I could do was hold my head, because her mother had done exactly that an episode before, so both of them had done it completely unnecessarily.

The only good what liked in this series was Blade,and the final battle,but it was also short, and I missed the more familiar characters there too.

In conclusion, I don't understand why they couldn't use the original comics as a basis. I had the same problem with What If, instead of doing something original, even if it's not canon, they stick to the characters known from the MCU movies.",89,33

Marvel Zombies,tt16027014,stefantodorovic-13218,"Sep 23, 2025",8,Marvel Zombies is very good!,"Marvel Zombies - A 10/10 Experience

Marvel Zombies is one of those rare stories that takes a familiar universe and turns it completely upside down in the most creative, horrifying, and entertaining way possible. From the very first page, it hooks you with a chilling premise: what if Earth's mightiest heroes were infected with a virus that turns them into flesh-eating monsters? What follows is a brilliant blend of horror, dark comedy, and twisted superhero action that feels fresh and unforgettable.

The writing is sharp, unapologetically brutal, and at times surprisingly witty. Characters you've known for years are shown in a completely new light, not just as heroes, but as corrupted figures driven by hunger and instinct. Seeing icons like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Captain America struggling against (or fully embracing) their monstrous urges is both unsettling and fascinating. It's a story that doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries, and that's exactly what makes it so compelling.

The art complements the tone perfectly-gruesome when it needs to be, but also detailed enough to show the tragic expressions behind the zombies' faces. It strikes a balance between grotesque and stylish, keeping you engaged without ever feeling repetitive.

What makes Marvel Zombies a perfect 10/10 for me is its ability to shock while still being deeply entertaining. It's not just gore for the sake of gore; there's genuine imagination behind every twist, every downfall, and every haunting ""what if"" scenario. It expands the Marvel mythos in a way that feels bold and experimental, and it leaves you thinking about it long after you've put it down.

Marvel Zombies isn't just a comic-it's an experience, and one that I'd recommend to any fan of superheroes, horror, or just bold storytelling.

I mean who the hell would ever believe a literal zombie, especially the scarlet witch whose main power is mind manipulation and also killed your friends and everyone who helped you along the way during time of crisis. And what's the disrespect to Thor, I mean, okay he's depressed and all that still... he's all sparks when fighting Wanda but the moment he becomes a rotting zombie he starts bringing down lightning 10 times the size he said was the biggest lightning he ever made in Ragnarok like nothing. Also the Moon Knight Blade who can be considered almost immortal dies in vain to Thor. And PLOTHOLE the Stormbreaker that Thanos destroys with the power stone magically reappears in the end. Another PLOTHOLE Thor lying unconcious near the explosion of Infinity Stones said to be extremely lethal survives. Adding another point, okay Nova Corps might quarantine the zombie infested planet to prevent its spread but who in their right mind would leave it to fester like that for years? Especially if its a planet where the Mad Titan was last seen and people like Tony Stark who is said to be known across the galaxy for his intellect.

Got serious comic vibes, too. Unexpected crossovers everywhere (like Blade rocking Moon Knight moves, Kamala leading the squad, and Spider-Man going full web-head decapitation mode), plus wild team-ups and power mashups you'll never see in regular MCU. Feels like the writers just grabbed random hero cards and said ""Let's smash!"" - pure fan service, but in the best way.

The story was brilliant, with an exciting pace that kept you eager for what would happen next. The clever use of characters was a highlight; not only were they featured, but they were also cleverly employed, giving each character a distinct dimension. Wanda appeared as we know her: an unstoppable force, while the Hulk, with his immense powers powered by the Infinity Stones, astonished in a fantastic and dazzling battles. Kamala Khan, on the other hand, brought a refreshing spirit that made her the beating heart of the series, and the presence of Blade Moon Knight was undeniable, with all his magnificence and charisma.

The graphics and animation were top-notch, giving the series a luxurious visual dimension befitting the Marvel Universe. The violence and gore were presented with boldness and professionalism, making it arguably one of Marvel's best in this regard. Added to this is the legendary music that deepened the atmosphere and gave every moment its dramatic weight.

Although the series is almost devoid of moments of boredom, the open and shocking ending may leave the viewer thirsty for more. Nevertheless, the work remains well-rounded, blending visual power and dramatic depth into an unforgettable experience.

Marvel's Wonder Man is a spectacular act of disrespect to Simon Williams and a masterclass in how to waste a character.

In the comics, Simon Williams is a tragic, angry, complicated man-betrayed by his own choices, experimented on by AIM and Baron Zemo, turned into a living ionic weapon, and dragged through guilt, redemption, death, and rebirth. That history matters. It's the entire point of Wonder Man. The fandom page alone has a richer arc than this whole show manages in eight episodes.

The Disney+ series throws all of that straight into the trash and replaces it with a smug, meta, fourth-wall-adjacent Hollywood sitcom that thinks it's clever for mocking itself instead of actually telling a story. AIM? Gone. Zemo? Gone. The experimentation, the moral conflict, the sense that Simon's powers came at a terrible cost?

And no-this isn't about race. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is a strong actor. But the show gives him nothing to work with. This version of Simon Williams isn't reinvented; he's hollowed out. If you're going to race-swap a character, you'd better honor the core of who he is. This show doesn't. It strips Simon of his comic identity, then wears his name like a costume.

The acting suffers because the writing is terrified of sincerity. Everything is irony. Everything is self-aware. Nothing has weight. No stakes, no mythology, no audience clearly in mind. It's too shallow for comic fans, too inside-baseball for casual viewers, and too cowardly to be real superhero drama.

What really worked for me was the tone, the friendship, the characters, the emotions, and especially the incredible performance of Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Sir Ben Kingsley.

There are too many awful Marvel TV shows, and this can be added to the list. This simply is not a super hero show. Not sure why anyone would want to watch a show about super heroes just doing normal things. There are hundreds of normal boring drama shows out already, but when I pick something with the Marvel logo, it's because I want fun escapism, not long drawn out conversations about nothing. Save your time and re-watch Thor Ragnarok again.",62,80
Wonder Man,tt21066182,ggdxfjmxw,"Jan 27, 2026",1,Why,I am going to be honest I don't know anything about the wonder man comic book. This is horrible absolutely boring do not waste your time. I thought She-hulk was bad but this that look like the Godfather. Disney needs to stop making marvel tv shows. Acting is actually really good but the story is pointless. I do not care about any of the characters. Please Disney stop.,48,91

I have absolutely no idea how or more importantly why would they disregard that story and create this instead. It just doesn't make any sense.",61,73
Wonder Man,tt21066182,MohammadS-6357,"Jan 27, 2026",9,"A Character First, a Superhero Second""","In an era where the MCU increasingly prioritizes spectacle over substance, Wonder Man stands out by doing something surprisingly rare: it takes time to build a character before asking us to cheer for a hero. Instead of throwing another powered individual into a city-saving montage, the series focuses on identity, loneliness, guilt, and self-control-making Simon Williams one of the more relatable protagonists Marvel has introduced in recent years.

Simon's journey is not about discovering power, but about learning how to live with it. His need to control outcomes, his struggle with perfection, and his isolation feel human rather than heroic. Unlike many recent MCU characters-where powers appear suddenly and purpose follows immediately-Wonder Man allows its lead to remain flawed, uncertain, and emotionally grounded.

Trevor Slattery's return is another unexpected strength. Once used primarily as comic relief, he is given emotional weight here. His guilt, quiet sacrifice, and guidance transform him into a mentor figure, reinforcing the show's central theme: identity is something earned, not performed. His dynamic with Simon mirrors the series' larger message about authenticity over image.

This approach places Wonder Man closer in spirit to Iron Man (2008) and Loki (Season 1) than to many recent MCU entries. Like Tony Stark, Simon's arc begins with ego and gradually shifts toward responsibility. And like Loki, the series prioritizes internal conflict over external battles. However, unlike projects such as Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, or She-Hulk, where character development often feels rushed or secondary, Wonder Man earns its emotional beats through patience and restraint.

That said, viewers expecting constant superhero action may find the series subdued. This is not a fight-driven show, and it doesn't try to be. Its strength lies in introspection, not escalation.

Ultimately, Wonder Man succeeds because it remembers what the MCU once did best: making audiences care about the person before the powers. If Marvel wants to combat superhero fatigue, this kind of writing isn't optional-it's essential.",97,37
Wonder Man,tt21066182,lanceanthony-87080,"Jan 27, 2026",1,Boring and dated,"I have been a Marvel fan, since I was a boy. I am now in my 40's. Wonderman, was a major villain, then hero, in the comics. Marvel rushed the end of the Infinity saga. Wonderman, like several other characters, such have appeared much earlier. That aside, the writing and pace of comic book adaptations has massively improved since 2008. Wonderman feels like it would have been ""okay"" ten years ago. Like Cage and Iron Fist were released ten years ago. They both have greater death and breath, and as far as I'm aware, won't be continued. Marvel scaled back and cancelled projects to focus on greater quality productions. Wonderman is not that. This slot could have been filled with a Moon Knight season 2, which would have been much more appreciated by MCU and Marvel fans. I think attention needs to be paid to fans of the franchise. Where's the gambit we've been promised for years? Where's Blade? Where's Punisher? Moon Knight? This was just rubbish. To be getting scores of over 8, Kev must be paying people.",46,87

I don't understand why it's so hard to bring quality, comic book based content to the screen when everything has been practically given to you, gift wrapped in the form of the comic books themselves.

Wonder Man definitely goes into the enjoyed category. I love that they released all 8 episodes at once because this works best as a binge watch. You're not going to want to wait a week between episodes and you don't have to. It's gotten nothing but great reviews as it currently has 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Bottom line is Wonder Man is an original and fun show which is what you want from a superhero series.",108,19
Wonder Man,tt21066182,coldpizza_5o4,"Jan 27, 2026",9,Wonderful Surprise,I went in thinking this show would be terrible because of the binge model; I was totally wrong this show was astonishing character study. Simon' character is relatable to people with big dreams and the question will you eventually succumb because of failures. The Duo of Yahya & Ben Kingsley doesn't look like it would work but it does amazingly. This is real writing and directing none of that MCU cheese in the dialogue. If this wasn't Marvel/Disney it could come off as a passion project the creators behind this show really put the time and effort to make this show great!,90,36
Wonder Man,tt21066182,Rob1331,"Feb 1, 2026",8,Better than I thought it would be,"Marvel's Wonder Man was even better than I expected. It's about a Hollywood actor named Simon Williams who gets a part as a superhero as he develops real super powers of his own. I have to say that it was a lot funnier than I though it would be too but what makes the show really good is the performances from the cast, specifically Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Ben Kingsley. Everyone already knows what a great actor Kingsley is but Abdul-Mateen really shows what a good actor he is here. I'm looking forward to seeing more from him in his career going forward. If you're looking for a good show to watch where you can just turn your mind off and enjoy then give this a try.",97,17
Wonder Man,tt21066182,arrownik,"Jan 29, 2026",1,Masterclass in Boredom,"The ""Wonder"" is Why I'm Still Watching I sat down with my popcorn expecting the next big MCU spectacle, but after eight episodes of Wonder Man, I feel like I've been scammed. If you're in India and you've grown up on high-octane mass cinema or even the peak Infinity War era, this show is going to feel like watching paint dry in slow motion.

Why it Fails (Badly): Where is the Action? We were promised a superhero, but we got a struggling actor. Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) spends more time worrying about his ""process"" and ""self-tapes"" than actually using his powers. In a country where we love our heroes to be larger-than-life, Simon is just... a guy who's bad at auditions.

The Trevor Slattery Problem: I know Ben Kingsley is a legend, but bringing back Trevor Slattery for this much screen time? It's just old men talking about the ""theatre"" and ""artistic integrity."" I didn't tune into Marvel to watch a meta-commentary on the 80s film industry.

The ""Marvel Spotlight"" Trap: They called this a ""grounded"" story. In reality, that's just code for ""we didn't have the budget for CGI."" The few times Simon actually uses his powers, it's over in seconds. It's a superhero show that is allergic to being a superhero show.

The Runtime: Each episode is barely 30 minutes, yet it feels like three hours. The pacing is sluggish, and the ""satire"" of Hollywood feels incredibly Western and disconnected from what makes a show engaging for us here.",50,57

Here's to hoping he continues to trip over his own 2 feet. May Marvel and we, as the viewer be subject to monumental failures for the foreseeable future!

The much more grounded story with a focus away from the action is a unique view on the world of the MCU, and Simon and Trevor's view is the perfect way to tell it. Wonder Man manages to deliver a powerful story of growth while not only building up a great new character, but serving as the perfect end for the story of a long beloved one. Episode 4 was the best. However, the ending of Epsiode 8 left much to be desired.",54,33
Wonder Man,tt21066182,qwityurbichin,"Jan 27, 2026",10,Wonderful,"Marvel just knows what to do. They tell human stories, and they use superpowers to magnify the human condition. This is another example of a story that is just expertly told with emotion and comedy. There's little thing's I might change if it was a perfect world, but overall the story and performances are top notch. I also like the way my expectations were subverted. It reminded me of She-Hulk in a way that it's not the usual superhero story. This doesn't fit in a mold at all. It's a story of friendship, human relationships, and the way we help and hurt each other. It's life put in motion on the small screen, and i truly hope Marvel has more like this coming. Also, I loved seeing the Mandarin from Iron Man 3 and Shang Chi brought back. Iron Man 3 was the first Marvel project i remember breaking the mold, and I love that they keep showing a willingness to experiment and put story first.",43,41
Wonder Man,tt21066182,LeonardoOliva69,"Feb 2, 2026",8,"Bromance gives us one of the best series in the MCU, but with almost no connections...","It seems that Marvel, when we least expected it, gave us a real gem.

What's happening with ""Wonder Man"" is something that hasn't been seen in previous years. Word of mouth has allowed a series without prior marketing, and perhaps with many people who weren't even aware of its premiere, to become one of the best in the MCU.

And what's even worse is that it doesn't follow the typical formula of the other series and has no connections to the others.

We knew Yahya Abdul-Mateen II from the wonderful and underrated ""Watchmen"" series and for being Black Manta in the ""Aquaman"" movies. This man truly has an incredible presence, without a doubt. He has a bearing that not everyone can maintain, and he's one of the pillars and cornerstones for this to work.

On the other hand, we have Trevor Slattery, played by the always reliable Ben Kingsley, whom we all hate because of ""Iron Man 3."" Both in the Shang-Chi movie and here, his character undergoes a complete transformation and acquires such complexity that we fully empathize with him.

But we can't forget that the showrunner of that series was also on ""Shang-Chi"" and ""Spider-Man,"" so it's clear he's someone who does excellent work.

It's clearly an experimental series, both in its episode length and because they were all released simultaneously, but also because narratively we have a fifth episode that we didn't know we needed. With Doorman's backstory, we understand why Simon is the way he is and why he tries to hide everything.

The entire whirlwind of Hollywood in this universe, how people struggle daily to achieve their dreams, and how we witness the evolution episode after episode is truly remarkable.

The ending, honestly, I think, along with ""Loki,"" are the best in the MCU series, and that's saying a lot (or rather, not much). Just as we haven't heard anything about Moonknight for 4 years, the same will surely happen with the escapades of Simon Williams and Trevor Slattery...we'll see if that's the case or not.",67,16
Wonder Man,tt21066182,john-lancia-1,"Jan 28, 2026",3,Ridiculous premise,"So Wonderman doesn't want to be wonderman because its going to get in the way of his acting career. Silly.

I realize that the creators of this show, who are so deeply immersed in the plastic and fake entertainment industry probably think that what they're doing is really important and really makes a difference in peoples lives. But the fact of the matter is that it doesn't. Its just entertainment.

No one, who wasn't mentally impaired, would choose being an actor over a superhero/supervillain. That the creators of the show think that this is a valid plot point says more about them than it does for anything close to human behaviour.

I guess this silliness passes for deep serious writing in Hollywood, but it seems ridiculous out here in real life.",34,48
